# The Blog Machine

The program that turns the admin portal into a content engine: check posts in
the queue or paste a URL, and a professional, visually rich post in the
owner's voice comes out the other end — announced on Telegram with a staging
link, approved with one reply, live a minute later. The manual editor path
stays exactly as it is; the machine is an addition, not a replacement.

This page is the program of record: the architecture, the phase plan the
tracker entries (TODO.md **T-601…T-607**) point at, the module-grammar
contract both packages must match, the decisions already made, and the
backlog.

**Status: engineering complete (2026-08-28).** All seven phases landed —
Phase 0 + plan (#236), Phase 1 (#237), Phase 2 (#238), Phase 3 (#239),
Phase 4 (#240), Phase 5 (#241), Phases 6–7 (#242 and the close-out PR) —
closed to CHANGELOG.md as one program entry. What remains is the
owner-gated activation checklist (below) and the backlog. Per-phase
"As built" notes record where the landed code deliberately differs from
the original spec text.

## What already exists — the load-bearing fact

**The forge pipeline is built and works end-to-end**
(`functions/src/lib/content/forge.js`): dedupe against published titles →
owner-voice + rotating-format prompt → draft → module validation and repair →
grade against the owner's profile → land at `forge_ready` (grade ≥ threshold
and clean) or `editing`, with version history, audit rows and stats. Automatic
hero images exist too: on `forge_ready` the pipeline arms
`altCoverImageTrigger`, and the live content change-feed
(`functions/src/functions/change-feed.js`) runs
`lib/triggers/ai-cover.js` — provider-themed covers via Replicate, written to
exactly the field the publish-time image gate reads.

What the program builds is everything *around* that engine, none of which
exists today:

| Missing | Today's reality |
| --- | --- |
| A way in | The only enqueue site anywhere (`/forge` in the Telegram bot) sends the wrong payload key and has always failed; the admin UI has no forge trigger at all (the unported T-409 Forge page) |
| A way to see the result | Nothing unpublished is reachable: the public API deliberately serves an identical 404 for drafts and missing docs |
| A way to hear about it | No notification fires when a post reaches `forge_ready`; the owner would have to poll the queue |
| A way to say yes | The bot has no approve/reject; publishing is a portal-only, multi-click flow |
| A way to sound like the owner | The voice config (`admin_config/forge_profile.wordSoup`, `forge_prompts`) has no admin UI or endpoint — it can only be seeded by hand in Cosmos |
| Enough visual vocabulary | 8 module types exist; no pull quote, stat board, comparison table, timeline, or titled callout |

## Decisions (made 2026-08-28, owner)

1. **Staging link = signed preview URL.** A tokenized `/preview/{id}?t=…`
   that renders the full production template and works when tapped straight
   from Telegram, no sign-in. Expires in 72 h; invalid or expired tokens 404
   indistinguishably from missing content.
2. **Telegram approve = publish live immediately** — through the full publish
   pipeline (`processPublishContent`), never a raw status write, so every
   quality/image/slug gate still applies. Reject sends the post to rejected
   with the reason in the audit trail.
3. **Heroes: the existing AI cover pipeline is primary** (Replicate,
   provider-themed; needs `REPLICATE-API-KEY`); a curated set of **designed
   per-provider default heroes is the deterministic fallback** when
   generation is unconfigured or fails. Zero posts blocked on imagery.
4. **Sources are internal-only.** `sourceUrl` stays on the document for
   admin views and provenance and is never rendered publicly. The prose is
   original analysis in the owner's voice, not a re-skin — the grader and
   banned-phrase guardrails enforce the voice, and the dedupe gate enforces
   distance from what is already published.

## Architecture (as it will run)

```

Every arrow reuses an existing mechanism: the jobs platform
(`lib/jobs.js` + storage queue), the content change-feed with rising-edge
claims, `notifyTelegram` keyed per post id, and the injected
`processPublishContent` exactly as the scheduled-publish timer already uses it.

## Phases

Each phase is sized to one PR. Dependency order: 0 → {1, 2, 3, 4a}
independent → 4b → 5 → 6 → 7.

### Phase 0 — Quick fixes (T-601)

- `functions/src/lib/telegram/bot.js`: `/forge` enqueues `{ contentId }` but
  `resolveForgeTargets` accepts only `sourceContentId`/`sourceContentIds` —
  the repository's only forge entry point has always failed. Fix the key and
  strengthen the bot test to assert the payload shape (the existing test
  checked the job type only, which is how the bug shipped).
- `frontend/src/components/templates/BlogDetailTemplate.jsx`: the modular
  render path drops `markdownCodeComponents`, so fenced code inside
  modularized posts silently loses syntax highlighting. Pass the same
  components map the fallback path already uses.

### Phase 1 — URL → draft (T-602)

Implement `generateArticleDraft` **HTTP-direct** (admin-authed): scrape the
URL (`lib/content/scrape.js` `scrapeArticle`, fallback chain capped ~20 s) →
`createDrafter().generateDraft` — whose output is already exactly the shape
`SubmitUrlsPage.jsx` and the editor expect. Internal budget ~75 s under the
90 s client timeout; contingency if real-world drafting breaks the window:
both call sites flip to a `draft-from-url` job polled via the existing
`runJob()` client. Requires the `.azure/api-surface.json` contract move
(notImplemented → implemented, same change, enforced by
`api-contract.test.js`) and an `AI_FEATURES` entry.

Also in this phase: extract the voice/format prompt block currently composed
twice (`forge.js` and `drafting.js`) into one builder in `voice.js`, and add
an unattended **`forge-from-url`** job — scrape → source content doc
(`sourceUrl` internal-only) → `runForgePipeline` — with a paste box on the
queue header calling `runJob('forge-from-url', { url })`.

### Phase 2 — Queue → forge: "Forge Selected" (T-603)

The queue already has per-card checkboxes and a `selectedIds` Set, wired only
to bulk-reject. Add `forgeSelected(ids)` in
`frontend/src/pages/admin/queue/useQueueActions.js`, chunking ≤10 (the
`FORGE_MAX_BATCH` cap) into `runJob('forge-article', { sourceContentIds })`;
a select-all header checkbox; and forge provenance/grade badges on queue
cards. The smallest phase — everything else already exists.

### Phase 3 — Forge Studio: the voice, editable (T-604; the T-409 remainder)

Two new authenticated RPCs — `getForgeConfig` / `updateForgeConfig`
(whitelist-validated writes to `admin_config/forge_profile` and
`forge_prompts`, audit rows, contract additions) — and a new admin page:
voice profile (wordSoup, interest areas with weights), master prompt,
guardrails (banned phrases, style rules), quality threshold, automation
(autoForge + dailyLimit, live in Phase 6), a read-only format-rotation
viewer, and the forge-stats scoreboard. Plus **voice calibration**: a job
that reads the owner's published posts and produces *suggested* wordSoup
additions and style hints as accept/dismiss chips — never merged
automatically, so the profile stays the owner's own.

### Phase 4a — Richer modules: grammar + public render (T-605)

First commit: unify the duplicate module serializer (`BoardTab.jsx` adopts
`lib/moduleParser.js`) so new types are implemented once. Then five new
types, all built from components and tokens the site already owns:

| type | body | built from | payload | pairing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pull_quote` | JSON | Bookerly + provider accent rule | `{"text","attribution"?}` (text required) | pairable |
| `stat_board` | JSON | `shared/StatBlock.jsx` glass tiles | `{"stats":[{"value","label","sublabel"?}]}` (2–4, value+label required) | full width |
| `comparison` | JSON | glass-styled table + theme vars | `{"columns":[…],"rows":[[…]]}` (≥2 columns, ≥1 row, row length = columns) | full width |
| `timeline` | JSON | `.section-number` zero-padded markers | `{"steps":[{"title","body"?}]}` (≥2, title required) | full width |
| `callout` | JSON | `Eyebrow` label + titled glass frame | `{"eyebrow"?,"title","body"}` (title+body required) | pairable |
| `design` (repaired) | raw Mermaid | labelled mono frame (client-side mermaid render = backlog) | — | full width |

Two grammar-wide rules: a JSON module body must parse to a plain object (a
bare `5` or an array is rejected), and `MAX_MODULES` is **14** on both
sides. As-built (PR for T-605): `design` previously existed only in the
backend list — the frontend parser round-tripped it to an empty body,
destroying the diagram; it is now a raw type in both parsers with a
regression test. The forge instruction's spacer style `dotted` was fixed to
the renderer's key `dots`.

Backend: `KNOWN_MODULE_TYPES` / `JSON_MODULE_TYPES` and per-type semantic
validation live in `lib/cms/content-modules.js`; the repair pass in
`lib/content/forge-pipeline.js` unwraps semantically-broken modules into
faithful plain markdown (blockquote / stat list / GFM table / numbered
list / bold-title paragraph) so no prose is lost. Frontend: exported
`RAW_MODULE_TYPES` / `JSON_MODULE_TYPES` / `MAX_MODULES` in
`lib/moduleParser.js`, renderers in `InlineModules.jsx`, pairing rules in
`lib/modulePairing.js` (`FULL_WIDTH_MODULE_TYPES` =
spacer/stat_board/comparison/timeline/design never pair). **This section is
the cross-package grammar contract of record** — backend and frontend
cannot import each other's lists, so each side carries a test asserting its
list matches this table (`content-modules.test.js` /
`moduleParser.test.js`).

### Phase 4b — Teach the forge; make the editor honest (T-605)

Extend `MODULE_TAG_SYNTAX` with syntax + a good/bad example per new type;
update each `FORMAT_LIBRARY` entry's module list (comparison →
comparison + stat_board; case_study → timeline + pull_quote; contrarian →
pull_quote + callout; …). Editor forms for the new types; share
`ARTICLE_PROSE_CLASS` between `BlogDetailTemplate` and `PreviewPanel` so the
in-editor preview stops rendering with the wrong typography.

### Phase 5 — Staging preview + the Telegram loop (T-606)

- **Signed preview route** `GET /api/public/preview/{contentId}?t={token}`:
  token = HMAC-SHA256(`PREVIEW_SIGNING_SECRET`, `contentId.exp`), 72 h
  expiry, serves only `{forge_ready, editing, approved}`, and answers
  invalid/expired/missing identically (404) — preserving the public-reads
  invariant in spirit. The first token-signing code in `functions/src`; the
  route is a deliberate, justified addition to `PUBLIC_ROUTES` in
  `route-inventory.test.js`. Secret seeded via the approved vault procedure.
  Frontend `/preview/:id` reuses `BlogDetailTemplate`, carries `noindex`,
  and stays out of the prerender manifest.
- **Notification**: a `forge_ready` rising-edge branch in the content
  change-feed handler (`lib/triggers/handlers.js`, `claimRisingEdge` per the
  ai-cover precedent) → `notifyTelegram` with `source: 'forge_ready:{id}'`
  (per-post cooldown keying) carrying title, grade, format, the preview
  link, and the command hints.
- **Commands**: `/approve {id}` → enqueue a new `publish-content` job whose
  handler calls the injected `processPublishContent` with `markLive: true` —
  the same reuse contract the scheduled-publish timer documents ("it calls
  `processPublishContent`, it does not reimplement publishing").
  `/reject {id} [reason]` → `transitionContentStatus`
  (forge_ready → rejected is a valid edge), reason to the audit trail. Both
  in `TOGGLEABLE_COMMANDS`.
- **Heroes**: ai-cover runs automatically; add the deterministic fallback —
  when generation is unconfigured or errored, assign a curated per-provider
  default hero (owner uploads ~8 via the image gallery once; mapping in
  `admin_config`).
- **5b (follow-up)**: inline Approve / Reject / Preview buttons — widen
  `allowed_updates` to `['message','callback_query']` in
  `scripts/cutover/04-telegram-webhook.ps1` (ride the T-526 re-registration
  the owner must run anyway), dispatch `callback_query`, answer with
  `answerCallbackQuery`.

**As built (#241).** Three deliberate deltas from the spec text above. The
token verification lives in a new `lib/public-preview.js` rather than
`lib/public-reads.js`, preserving that module's zero-imports invariant
(node:crypto is needed). The notification's failure semantics invert
ai-cover's: an unsent notification writes NOTHING to the document — a
failure marker would re-fire the change feed and loop — so the flag stays
armed and the fresh claim quiets retries for its 15-minute window; the flag
clears only after a confirmed send, and an unseeded secret still notifies,
saying the link is unavailable. `/reject` runs
`createContentStatusTransitioner`, the state-machine core extracted from the
HTTP handler so the guarded route and the bot share one writer (audit rows
carry `authMethod: telegram_webhook`). Found and fixed in passing: the
bot's `/ack`/`/resolve` passed the alertId as `patchDoc`'s updates argument
and had never persisted anything (T-512-era).

### Phase 6 — Throughput: the machine runs itself (T-607)

Arm `forgeScheduled`, `syncRssFeeds` and `publishScheduledContent`
(**Gate: owner** — T-518's workspace variables and four-gate procedure);
enforce `autoForge.dailyLimit` with a counter in `forge_stats`; rank forge
candidates by interest-area weights from the profile; add an optional
per-job-type `onComplete` hook in `lib/jobs.js` used for **failure**
notifications only — successes already ride the Phase 5 rising edge, and
double-pinging the owner defeats the point.

**As built (#242).** The counter is a rolling `forge_stats.today` bucket
(`{ date, forged }`, reset on UTC date change) bumped by every forge run —
scheduled, `/forge`, and forge-from-url — so the daily limit is one ledger,
not a per-caller count; `forgeScheduled` spends only the day's remaining
budget and skips at the limit. Ranking: an interest area scores when any of
its keywords hits the candidate's title/topics/provider; ties keep query
order (`scoreCandidate`/`rankCandidates` in `lib/timers/forge-scheduled.js`).
The `onComplete` hook fires after the terminal status write for all three
outcomes and is best-effort; `createJobFailureOnComplete`
(`lib/job-failure-notify.js`, cooldown per `job_failed:{type}`) is wired to
forge-article, forge-from-url and publish-content. The timer also adopted
the process-wide `defaultForgeConfig` (the #239 singleton lesson).

### Phase 7 — Polish and program close (T-607)

Grade sorting and a forged-today `n/dailyLimit` indicator on the queue; a
`/queue`-style bot view of pending `forge_ready` items; this page updated to
as-built; tracker entries closed to CHANGELOG.

**As built (close-out PR).** "Forge grade" joined the queue's sort dropdown
(ungraded items sort last in descending); the header shows a
`Forged today: n/limit` meter read from the same `forge_stats.today` bucket
the scheduler enforces (via `getForgeConfig`, which now returns it); the
bot's `/queue` appends a "Staged for approval" list — newest five
forge_ready items with grade and an inline `/approve {id}` per row.

## Owner-gated dependencies

| What | Why it gates | Tracker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Telegram webhook re-registration | The entire Phase 5 loop is dead while the webhook points at GCP — and silently dead after the GCP deletion | **T-526** |
| Timer arming (workspace variables + four gates) | Phase 6's scheduled forge/publish/RSS are permanent no-ops until armed | **T-518** |
| `PREVIEW_SIGNING_SECRET` seeding | Signed preview links | vault procedure |
| `REPLICATE-API-KEY` seeding | Auto hero generation (fallback heroes cover its absence) | vault procedure |
| ~8 default hero uploads + mapping | The deterministic hero fallback | Phase 5 |

## Backlog — unique and cool, deliberately unscheduled

1. **Social captions auto-queued to Publer on publish** — **LANDED**
   (post-program). `generateSocialCaption` is implemented (the Social Hub
   Generate button works; feature-gated as `socialCaption` in the AI
   switches), and a live publish arms `socialCaptionTrigger` once per
   document → the change feed generates a caption and bulk-schedules it in
   Publer with a delay (default 60 min — the undo window), recording a
   `social_posts` doc the existing reconcile timer adopts by `publerJobId`.
   Publer unconfigured → the caption is kept as a Social Hub draft. Switched
   by the owner-seeded `admin_config/social_autopost`
   `{ enabled, accountIds: [{ id, provider }], scheduleDelayMinutes }` —
   absent or disabled means no model call and no post.
2. **The manual image RPC cluster** — **LANDED** (post-program). All four
   (`generatePreviewImages`, `generateCuratedArticleImage`,
   `generateReviewHeroImage`, `triggerAiImageGeneration`) were live 404s
   the admin UI called; they now exist in `lib/manual-images.js`, sharing
   ai-cover's extracted generation core (`generateCoversForContent`)
   rather than duplicating it. `triggerAiImageGeneration` stays
   fire-and-forget by arming the change-feed flag; the other three are
   synchronous and 503 cleanly while `REPLICATE-API-KEY` is unseeded.
3. **Weekly digest send** (`generateReviewerDigestManual` over the existing `generate-weekly-digest` job).
4. **Analytics-informed topic weighting** — engagement data feeding interest-area weight *suggestions* (accept/dismiss, like voice calibration).
5. **Series detection + interlinking** — forge finds related published posts and proposes a sibling-links module; series metadata on content docs.
6. **SEO lint in the grader** — meta-description length, slug/keyword alignment, heading hierarchy as advisory dimensions.
7. **Voice-drift monitor** — periodic re-grade of recent posts against the profile; Telegram alert on drift.
8. **Stale-post refresh bot** — old posts feeding a news_analysis/update-format forge run on the owner's own content.
9. **A/B titles** — drafter emits three candidates; owner picks via Telegram buttons (5b infrastructure).
10. **Voice memo → draft** (`createContentFromRecording` — the Plaud path).
11. **Cross-provider duplicate-angle advisor** — extend the title dedupe across providers as an advisory signal.
