"""Claude Code lifecycle hook: local audit records plus an opt-in Stop completion guard.

Fail-open by design: any missing file, unreadable state, or absent validator
results in exit 0 (allow). The hook can only block a Stop when ALL of these
are true: an active workflow exists, that workflow set enforce_stop=true at
init (--enforce-stop), the validator script exists, and validation fails.

That cascade used to live inline in `main` as nine separate `return 0`s, which
is what a fail-open contract looks like when it is written once per condition.
It is one contract, so it is one function per question now — each answering
"allow" for everything it cannot read. test_claude_event.py covers both halves,
the blocking one included; before it, only the no-state case was tested.
