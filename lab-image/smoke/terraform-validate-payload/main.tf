# A payload shaped like the Landing Zone Builder's output: registry sources
# with version constraints, exactly as a learner would download and as the
# `terraform-validate` job receives it. smoke.sh hands this directory to
# hcw-terraform-validate with no network; the script rewrites each module
# below to its vendored copy under /opt/avm and the init must then succeed.
# Nothing here is changed by that: the rewrite happens on the tmpfs copy.
#
# One block per module the builder emits, each called once, and each
# constraint satisfied by the version the builder pins:
# scripts/lab-image-avm-vendoring.test.mjs holds this file to that, because
# smoke.sh expects exactly one rewrite per builder module. The constraints
# differ on purpose, to exercise the operators hcw-terraform-validate
# evaluates; the spoke's is `>= 0.15.0` so that both vendored versions of
# avm-res-network-virtualnetwork (0.15.0, a child of the connectivity
# module, and 0.22.2) satisfy it and the highest must be chosen.
# sandbox-check.mjs validates the builder's real default build as well.
