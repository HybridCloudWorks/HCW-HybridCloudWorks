# ADR 0032: The learner labs platform — a Terraform-managed Hostinger host under Azure Arc, Docker only, Coder as the learner boundary, and public submission locked to the site's pane

**Status:** Accepted 2026-09-27 (owner: "all have been approved to move forward"); amended 2026-09-26 and 2026-09-28; amendment of 2026-09-29 (Vault auto-unseal, #726) accepted by the owner and live on the host the same day. Decision 6 was revised on 2026-09-28: public submission is open, only from the Landing Zone Builder's pane on the site, locked by the request's origin and a Cloudflare Turnstile token, within decision 6's original bounds, which are unchanged. Also on 2026-09-28 the site began embedding Coder, in a pane on each lab's page, which decision 4 had ruled out and the alternatives had rejected ([amendment of that date](#amendment-2026-09-28-coder-in-the-sites-panes), #750 and #751).
**Decision date:** 2026-09-25
**Owners:** Workload owner and architecture owner

## Context

The estate has a Hostinger VPS that nothing manages. `vps-agent/` is a
pull-based Node job runner that dials out to the Functions API, claims a job,
runs it in `docker run --network none` against a digest-pinned image, and posts
the result back. It is admin-only: `enqueueLabJob` in `functions/src/lib/labs.js`
requires the `editor` role, and the public submission path the source
repository had (`submitPublicLabJob`) was deliberately not ported. No host is
provisioned ([Required inputs §4.7](../standards/required-inputs.md#47-vps-agent-hostinger-env-never-committed)),
and until this record [the target architecture](../architecture/architecture.md)
§5.3 described a browser-submitted labs flow that does not exist.

Owner direction 2026-09-24: the VPS is an empty host, any OS. Rather than a
Kubernetes lab, make it the **on-premises half of a real hybrid estate** —
provisioned by Terraform, configured by Ansible, onboarded to Azure Arc so it
appears in the same tenant as the production Azure estate, monitored by the
existing Log Analytics workspace, and shown live on a public page. It then
hosts browser labs (Coder) and the existing `vps-agent`. Every step is a pull
request a follower can read and repeat for a few dollars a month.

Four epics build on this record: the lab host itself (#656), the Landing Zone
Builder (#657), the `hcw-lab` image and Docker sandbox (#658), and browser labs
on Coder (#659). Each of their sub-issues assumes the decisions below, so they
are recorded once, here, before any of them is implemented.

## Purpose and decision drivers

- **Blast radius.** A lab experiment must never be able to touch production
  Azure state, production secrets, or the site's sign-in. The host is
  third-party, reachable from the internet, and will run learner-supplied code.
- **Cost, against the USD 150/month ceiling of [ADR 0015](0015-cost-governance.md).**
  Hostinger is billed outside Azure ([cost analysis](../architecture/cost-analysis.md)).
  The Azure side must add nothing with a standing charge that the estate cannot
  already absorb.
- **Teachability.** The point of the host is that a follower can repeat it. A
  design that needs a Kubernetes distribution, a VPN gateway or a paid Defender
  plan is one fewer people will reproduce.
- **Supply chain.** Learner-facing images are pulled implicitly by `docker run`,
  before `--network none` takes effect. Whatever runs on the host must be pinned
  by digest, built from this repository, and reviewed like any other change
  (the rule `vps-agent/lib/capabilities.js` already enforces).
- **Security and operational excellence.** Least privilege on every identity
  the host holds; outbound-only where a protocol allows it; the existing
  alerting fabric ([ADR 0022](0022-alerting-fabric.md)) rather than a second one.

## Decision

1. **The VPS is Terraform-managed through the `hostinger/hostinger` provider
   (v0.1.22, January 2026) in its own HCP Terraform workspace.** Organisation
   `hcw`, workspace `hcw-lab`, VCS-driven from this repository with working
   directory `infra-lab/`, auto-apply off. The `hostinger_api_token` and
   `cloudflare_api_token` it needs are workspace variables, never repository
   values. Lab state and `hcw-azure` state never meet: nothing in `infra-lab/`
   reads `hcw-azure` outputs, and nothing in `infra/` reads `hcw-lab`.
2. **Ubuntu 26.04 LTS, and Docker Engine is the only runtime on the host.**
   (Owner decision 2026-09-26: the VPS was reinstalled with 26.04 LTS, the latest LTS, and stays on it; this line read 24.04 LTS until then.) No
   Kubernetes of any size (owner decision 2026-09-24; the earlier k3s idea is
   dropped). Coder and its PostgreSQL run as containers under Docker Compose.
   (Owner decision 2026-09-26: Coder's database stays this PostgreSQL container on the host, not Coder's built-in PostgreSQL or Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server B1ms, about $14 a month in compute; `lab-host/ansible/roles/coder/README.md`, "Where it runs", records both.)
   Caddy runs host-native from a pinned build that includes the
   `caddy-dns/cloudflare` module, because neither the stock package nor the
   official image carries it and DNS-01 needs it; its version and checksum
   are pinned in `lab-host/`. `vps-agent` runs host-native as a systemd
   service, because it drives the `docker` CLI itself and a container that
   drives the host daemon is no more contained than a service that does; its
   certificate at `/etc/hcw/labs-agent.pem` is `root:hcw-labs-agent` `0640`,
   readable by the service user and by nothing else. node-exporter is a
   host-native service too; the Arc agent runs as a host service because that
   is how Azure ships it.
3. **Azure Arc-enabled servers is the hybrid control plane.** Microsoft Learn
   lists Ubuntu 26.04 on x86-64 as a supported Arc-enabled servers operating
   system, and Ubuntu 26.04 LTS as supported by the Azure Monitor Agent (both
   read 2026-09-26). The host is
   onboarded as an Arc machine in a new resource group,
   `rg-lab-hybrid-prod-cus`, in the application subscription. Onboarding uses a
   service principal holding only **Azure Connected Machine Onboarding** on
   that resource group; its credential lives in Ansible Vault and never in the
   repository or on the host after onboarding. An Azure Monitor Agent data
   collection rule sends **heartbeat and `auth`/`authpriv` syslog only** into
   the existing Log Analytics workspace in `rg-mgmt-plat-prod-cus` (Management
   subscription). Machine configuration policy is **audit only**. Defender for
   Servers stays **off** for cost. Arc itself is free. The public lab page
   reads the host's Arc state through the Function App, never from the
   browser: the Function App's existing managed identity is granted
   **Reader on `rg-lab-hybrid-prod-cus` only** (an `azurerm_role_assignment`
   in `infra/`, #664) and queries Azure Resource Graph for the
   `microsoft.hybridcompute/machines` row (status, last heartbeat, agent
   version) and its policy compliance; the result is cached for a minute in
   `tool_service_cache` and answers `{ configured: false }` when the resource
   group does not exist, so the card shows an explicit absent state rather
   than a fabricated one. No new credential is involved; the role assignment
   is the whole grant.
4. **Coder (Community edition) is the learner identity boundary.** It runs
   from Docker Compose on the host with Docker-based workspaces, and learners
   sign in to it with **GitHub OAuth**, and only members of a GitHub
   organisation the owner names may sign in: `CODER_OAUTH2_GITHUB_ALLOWED_ORGS`
   is a required setting, not an option, because an absent or empty value
   lets any GitHub account consume the public VPS. It is therefore never
   empty while Coder runs, and the Ansible role refuses to render an empty
   value. The **kill switch is an explicit stop, not an emptied list**:
   `CODER_OAUTH2_GITHUB_ALLOW_SIGNUPS=false` closes the door to new learners
   while existing ones keep working, and stopping the `coder` Compose
   service closes it to everyone (Caddy then answers 503 for the Coder
   names). Two things on the host may drive the
   Docker daemon, and nothing else (a third, Portainer, owner-only and on the
   loopback, since the amendment of 2026-09-26 below): the Coder **server** container, which has
   the socket mounted because that is how Coder's documented Docker install
   creates workspaces, and `vps-agent`, which runs **host-native** as the
   `hcw-labs-agent` systemd service with its user in the `docker` group,
   because its runner executes the `docker` CLI
   (`vps-agent/lib/docker-runner.js`). A workspace never receives the socket,
   a privileged flag or a host path, and the template test in #679 asserts
   that. The privilege boundary this leaves is recorded under consequences.
   The site never signs learners in and never embeds Coder:
   `frontend/staticwebapp.config.json` keeps `frame-src` at `'self'` plus the
   Entra sign-in origin and a closed `connect-src`. The site links out to
   `lab.hybridcloudworks.com` and shows lab status through a server-side proxy
   in the Function App, whose app settings `CODER_URL` and `CODER_STATUS_TOKEN`
   are Key Vault references to the secrets `CODER-URL` and
   `CODER-STATUS-TOKEN` in `kv-site-prod-cus-01` (vault names are hyphenated;
   the naming table in
   [Variables and secrets](../standards/variables-and-secrets.md) applies).
   (Owner decision 2026-09-28: the lab is reached only through panes on the site, which reverses "never embeds Coder" above and the iframe alternative rejected below; the lab side is recorded in [Labs host, "Panes only"](../architecture/labs-host.md#panes-only), and the site side in the [amendment of that date](#amendment-2026-09-28-coder-in-the-sites-panes). `frame-src` now admits Coder's two names; `connect-src` stays closed and the status proxy is unchanged.)
5. **One toolchain, published as digest-pinned images from a new `lab-image/`
   directory.** The images go to GHCR (and to Docker Hub once an organisation
   exists there) and are the single toolchain for the lab pages, the Coder
   template and `vps-agent`. They carry a Terraform provider **filesystem
   mirror** and the Azure Verified Modules the Landing Zone Builder emits,
   **vendored** at pinned versions under `/opt/avm/<module>@<version>`, so
   `terraform init` succeeds under `--network none`: `init` downloads both
   providers and registry `module` sources, and a mirror alone still fails on
   the modules. Today the `terraform-validate` capability in
   `vps-agent/lib/capabilities.js` runs `terraform init -backend=false` inside
   a network-less container, so it can pass only for HCL that declares neither
   a provider nor a registry module; the mirror plus the vendored modules is
   what makes a real landing-zone configuration validatable. The learner's
   files are never changed for this: the builder's download and the submitted
   payload keep registry `source` and `version` lines, so the zip initialises
   anywhere with network, and the `terraform-validate` capability's fixed
   command is to rewrite those sources to the vendored paths on its own tmpfs
   copy inside the job before `init`. That rewrite does not exist yet: today
   `vps-agent/lib/capabilities.js` copies `main.tf` alone and runs `init`, so
   on the runner image it validates HCL whose providers are mirrored and
   whose modules are absent or fully vendored. #675 lands the rewrite, the
   multi-file payload and the transitive vendoring that `avm-ptn-alz` and the
   connectivity module need (measured in #686: one and thirteen registry
   child modules respectively); until then the full landing-zone output is
   not validatable offline and this record does not claim it is. These
   images are the learner and job toolchain only. The host's
   infrastructure services Coder and PostgreSQL run their upstream images,
   pinned by digest in the Compose file; Caddy, `vps-agent` and node-exporter
   are host-native, installed by Ansible at pinned versions with checksums.
6. **Anonymous public lab submission stays Gated.** Accepting this ADR does not
   open it. When a later revision does, the bounds are these and no wider:
   only the `terraform-validate` job type; a 64 KB payload; 2 submissions an
   hour per client and 50 a day globally; refused outright while more than 20
   jobs are queued; jobs written with `public: true` and a 1-day TTL. Until
   then, submission is `enqueueLabJob` from `/admin/labs` under the `editor`
   role, exactly as the code stands.
   (Revised 2026-09-28, owner decision; [the amendment of that date](#amendment-2026-09-28-decision-6-revised-open-only-from-the-sites-pane)
   below. The Gate is replaced by a lock to the Landing Zone Builder's pane
   on the site, the request's origin and a Cloudflare Turnstile token, and
   every bound in this paragraph stands as written. `enqueueLabJob` under the
   `editor` role is unchanged beside it.)

## Amendment 2026-09-26: a clean reinstall; Portainer and Vault on the host, loopback-only

**Context.** The owner's first `bootstrap.sh` run on the VPS failed at the
agent's checkout, because `/opt/hcw-labs-agent` held a July install of the
old agent. The host ran Ubuntu 26.04 but had never been reinstalled, which
the note under decision 2 assumed it had. It ran two self-hosted
GitHub Actions runners, Portainer EE 2.39.4, an nginx site on port 80, k3s,
Vault 1.17.5 and that agent. Before failing, the run upgraded Docker from
29.6.0 to 29.8.1 and restarted it, which killed a running Dependabot job,
enabled ufw and wrote the sshd hardening. Nothing was deleted.

**Owner decision 2026-09-26.** Reinstall the VPS clean. Nothing on it was
production, so nothing is exported. Portainer and Vault are part of the
clean deployment.

1. **`bootstrap.sh` refuses a host it was not prepared for.** On a host it
   has never accepted, it looks for other workloads before it changes
   anything: any Docker container, an installed `actions.runner.*` unit,
   Kubernetes units or directories, a foreign checkout at the repository or
   agent path, anything else under `/opt`, and a TCP listener other than
   sshd's and systemd-resolved's. It refuses with what it found, and names a
   reinstall or `HCW_ADOPT_NONEMPTY_HOST=1` as the two ways on. The first run
   that passes writes `/etc/hcw/bootstrap-host-accepted`, and later runs skip
   the check. Each check would have caught the host above.
2. **Portainer Business Edition, loopback only.** The `portainer` role runs
   Portainer BE 2.45.1 (LTS) by index digest, with a named volume and the
   Docker socket, published on `127.0.0.1:9443` and nowhere else, with plain
   HTTP off and no Caddy route. The owner reaches it through an SSH tunnel.
   It runs under Portainer's 3 Nodes Free licence (internal business use, one
   server instance, up to three nodes; this is one of each). The licence key
   and the administrator are entered in its UI and are in neither the
   repository nor the Ansible vault. Off until `portainer_enabled` is true.
   **This amends decision 4's "two things on the host may drive the Docker
   daemon".** Portainer is a third, and holding the socket makes it root on
   the host. That is bounded by who can reach it: only someone with an SSH
   login, which already carries `sudo`, so it adds no one who is not already
   root. A workspace or job container cannot reach it either: it listens on
   the host's loopback, and neither has host networking.
3. **HashiCorp Vault, loopback only, for lab-host secrets only.** The
   `vault` role runs Vault 2.1.1 host-native under systemd as the `vault`
   user, with integrated (raft) storage in `/var/lib/vault`, the API on
   `127.0.0.1:8200` and raft's cluster port on `127.0.0.1:8201`, and TLS from
   a certificate generated on the host. The download is checked against
   HashiCorp's GPG signature on the release's SHA256SUMS. The role never
   initialises or unseals Vault. `vault operator init` and every unseal are
   owner steps over SSH, and the unseal keys and root token go to the owner's
   password manager, never to the repository, a log or the Ansible vault. Off
   until `vault_enabled` is true.
   **The boundary.** This host runs untrusted learner workloads, and a
   workspace escape is root, which can read an unsealed Vault's memory. So
   this Vault holds lab-host secrets only and never a production
   HybridCloudWorks secret. Those stay in Azure Key Vault
   `kv-site-prod-cus-01`, which nothing on the host can read. It holds nothing
   that exists nowhere else, so the host still holds no data of record.
   **Follow-up, not built:** auto-unseal with an Azure Key Vault key, through
   the Arc machine's managed identity, would end the owner step after every
   restart. It must use a lab-only key vault and a grant on one key, never
   `kv-site-prod-cus-01`. That is
   [#726](https://github.com/HybridCloudWorks/HCW-HybridCloudWorks/issues/726),
   P3 on the board.
   (Accepted and live on the host 2026-09-29: the
   [amendment of that date](#amendment-2026-09-29-vault-auto-unseal-through-the-arc-identity).)

Consequences of this amendment:

- **Vault is sealed after every restart and every reboot**, including the
  unattended-upgrades reboot at 04:30, until the owner enters three of the
  five unseal keys. Anything on the host that reads from Vault must tolerate
  a sealed Vault. (Superseded 2026-09-29 by #726: the host now auto-unseals,
  so a restart comes back unsealed while Key Vault answers. The amendment of
  that date.)
- **The inbound policy is unchanged.** Both new services listen on the
  loopback, and nothing listens on a public address but sshd on 22 and Caddy
  on 80 and 443. Because Docker's rules for a published port come before
  ufw's, the `portainer` role refuses any publish address but `127.0.0.1`.
- **Portainer's licence is renewed yearly** at no cost while the use stays
  within three nodes. Its terms forbid using it "to provide services to third
  parties". Portainer is the owner's tool here and learners never reach it.
  If that changes, the Community Edition image is the same release with no
  key.

## Amendment 2026-09-28: decision 6 revised, open only from the site's pane

**Context.** #672 built the anonymous path behind decision 6's bounds and
left it closed (`LABS_PUBLIC_SUBMISSION_ENABLED` unset). The lab agent
`vps-hostinger-01` is registered and heartbeating, so the only thing between
the Landing Zone Builder's "Validate on the lab" and a real job was this
decision. The consequences below named the question the revision had to
answer: which client identifier the rate limits count.

**Owner decision 2026-09-28.** "The lab should only be accessible through
'panes' from my site, lock to that." Of the shapes put to the owner, the one
chosen is **the site's origin plus Cloudflare Turnstile**. The same decision
has a lab-host half, recorded under decision 4 and in
[Labs host, "Panes only"](../architecture/labs-host.md#panes-only) (#750):
Caddy lets only the site frame the lab and turns a direct visit away. This
amendment is the API half, for the one public route that queues work.

1. **Public submission is open, and only from the builder's pane on the
   site.** Decision 6's Gate is replaced by a lock, and nothing else about
   the decision moves: `terraform-validate` only, 64 KB, 2 an hour per
   client, 50 a day globally, refused while more than 20 jobs are queued,
   `public: true` with a 1-day TTL, and refused outright while no agent
   registered for the type has heartbeated. The lock is checked before any
   of those, and before any store read or counter moves, so a refused request
   costs the store nothing and spends no one's quota
   (`functions/src/lib/labs/public-lock.js`, `public-submit.js`).
2. **The origin.** A `POST /api/public/labs/submit` is refused
   `403 ORIGIN_NOT_ALLOWED` unless its `Origin` is exactly
   `https://hybridcloudworks.com` or `https://www.hybridcloudworks.com`, the
   production origins of the CORS allowlist (`functions/src/lib/auth/cors.js`),
   both of which serve the site. A missing Origin is refused, and so are the
   Static Web App's preview hostname and localhost, which CORS admits for
   other reasons. On its own this stops browsers on other sites and nothing
   else, because a script can send any header.
3. **A Cloudflare Turnstile token.** The builder renders a Turnstile widget
   (Managed mode, shown only when Cloudflare wants the visitor to act) once
   the lab is open, and sends its token with the submission. The Function App
   verifies it with Cloudflare's siteverify, passing the secret key and the
   client address `client-identity.js` trusts, and accepts only
   `success: true` for one of the site's two hostnames and the action
   `lab-validate`. Tokens are single use and live five minutes, so a replay
   fails at siteverify. Siteverify out of reach, or refusing the secret, is
   `503 TURNSTILE_UNAVAILABLE`, never a pass. Because the per-client quota
   needs the store and so comes after the lock, an in-memory limit per
   Function App instance allows one client ten checks in ten minutes and
   answers the next `429 TURNSTILE_RATE_LIMITED`, so junk tokens cannot drive
   a siteverify call per request (security review of this change). The two
   reads, the status and one job's output, stay anonymous and are not locked
   to the origin: they queue nothing, and a job is readable only by the
   random id its submission returned, for a day.
4. **The client identifier is the one #738 already uses.** The per-client
   bound counts the Cloudflare-verified, salted hash of `CF-Connecting-IP`,
   trusted only on a request carrying the origin secret, the identity every
   anonymous route shares. Turnstile is what makes that count mean a person
   at a browser rather than a script rotating addresses.
5. **Three switches, each failing closed.** `labs_public_submission_enabled`
   (default `true`, the owner's decision in code, reviewed in the pull request
   and read in the plan) sets `LABS_PUBLIC_SUBMISSION_ENABLED`; the Key Vault
   secret `TURNSTILE-SECRET-KEY`, read through the `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`
   reference, must resolve; and an agent must be online. The status read says
   which is missing: `PUBLIC_SUBMISSION_CLOSED`, `TURNSTILE_NOT_CONFIGURED` or
   `LAB_AGENT_OFFLINE`. A build of the site without the public site key
   `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` keeps the button disabled and says so. Setting
   the variable to `false` in the `hcw-azure` workspace is the one-step kill
   switch.
6. **The widget is created in the Cloudflare dashboard, not by Terraform.**
   The pinned provider has `cloudflare_turnstile_widget`, whose `secret` is a
   read-only attribute: managing it would put the secret key in HCP Terraform
   state, which [Variables and secrets](../standards/variables-and-secrets.md)
   forbids, and it needs an account id and an account-level Turnstile
   permission the zone-scoped `cloudflare_api_token` does not carry. The site
   key goes to the repository variable, the secret key to Key Vault through
   the API-keys page, as every other secret does. `infra/frontend.tf` records
   this beside the Cloudflare resources, and a test fails if the resource
   appears.

Consequences of this amendment:

- **The CSP grants `https://challenges.cloudflare.com` in `script-src` and
  `frame-src`, site-wide, and nowhere else.** Static Web Apps sends one
  policy for every page, so the grant is not scoped to the builder; the
  script is. Only the builder loads it, and only while the lab is open, so
  every other page makes no request to Cloudflare. `connect-src` is
  unchanged. `frontend/src/lib/csp.test.js` holds exactly this.
- **Cloudflare sees the builder's visitors.** Turnstile runs Cloudflare's
  browser challenge on the page and receives the visitor's address from
  siteverify. The site already sits behind Cloudflare's proxy, so no new
  party receives the address, but the challenge is new processing, so the
  site's privacy policy (`frontend/public/privacy-policy.html`) says so and
  links Cloudflare's Turnstile Privacy Addendum.
- **Turnstile raises the cost of automation; it does not end it.** A person
  can solve challenges for someone else. The bounds are what cap the
  damage: 2 an hour per verified address and 50 a day in total, against a
  `terraform-validate` job with no network, and decision 6 needs no change
  for that reason. The same bounds give one denial of service: about 50
  bought tokens from 25 addresses can use up the day's global cap and pause
  the button for everyone until midnight UTC. That costs availability, not
  data, and a per-network sub-cap is the answer if it is seen (revisit
  triggers).
- **One more owner-held secret, one more public value.** The secret key
  lives in Key Vault only and rotates by creating a new one in the dashboard
  and pasting it on the API-keys page. The site key rotates with it and needs
  a frontend deploy.
- **This amendment answers the client-identifier question that the
  "public path stays closed" consequence below left for the revision.**

## Amendment 2026-09-28: Coder in the site's panes

**Context.** Decision 4 said the site never embeds Coder, and "Embedding
Coder in the site" is listed below as a rejected alternative. The owner's
decision of 2026-09-28, "The lab should only be accessible through 'panes'
from my site, lock to that", reverses both. #750 applied the lab-host half:
Caddy answers every top-level visit to a lab name, Coder's included, with a
302 to `/education/labs`, and lets only the site frame the lab
([Labs host, "Panes only"](../architecture/labs-host.md#panes-only)). From
then on the site's "Open in Coder" links led straight back to the labs page.
This amendment is the site half (#751).

**Owner decision 2026-09-28.** Embedding Coder in the site, rejected when
this record was accepted, is now the chosen approach: a learner reaches Coder
only in a pane on the site.

1. **Each lab has a page that holds its pane.** `/education/labs/<id>`
   (`frontend/src/pages/shared/LabPanePage.jsx`) frames the lab's workspace
   deep link, `/templates/hcw-lab/workspace?mode=auto&param.lab=<id>`, and
   the cards on `/education/labs` link there. Its toolbar makes the pane
   itself full screen and goes back to the labs page. Nothing on the site
   links to Coder at the top level.
2. **`frame-src` gains exactly Coder's two names**,
   `https://coder.lab.hybridcloudworks.com` and
   `https://*.coder.lab.hybridcloudworks.com` (the workspace apps, where
   code-server runs). `connect-src` is unchanged. The rejected alternative
   assumed the site would have to open it, and it does not, because the site
   still reads Coder's status through the Function App (decision 4).
   `frontend/src/lib/csp.test.js` holds both.
3. **The frame gets what code-server needs and nothing more:**
   `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-popups"`, and
   `allow` for clipboard read, clipboard write and fullscreen, granted to
   those two origins by name. Scripts plus same-origin would let a frame of
   the page's own origin lift its sandbox; the pane is always another
   origin. There is no top-navigation flag, so the pane cannot navigate the
   site, and `frame-src` stops it navigating anywhere but Coder's names.
4. **GitHub sign-in runs in a tab of its own.** GitHub refuses to be
   framed. The pane page's "Sign in with GitHub" opens, in a new tab, the
   one Coder path #750 lets through at the top level,
   `/api/v2/users/oauth2/github/callback`. Coder v2.37.3 starts sign-in
   there when the request carries no `code`: it sets its state cookie and
   redirects to GitHub. After GitHub, Coder sets its session and redirects
   to a path of its own; that is a top-level visit, which #750 sends to
   `/education/labs`, and that page sends the tab on to the lab's pane. The
   first tab hears of it through a `storage` event and reloads its pane. The
   site holds no credential: it records in localStorage only that a sign-in
   was started and that one finished. The session is Coder's cookie on its
   own name, which reaches the pane because the site and the lab are one
   site (the same registrable domain), so it is not a third-party cookie.
   The page comment in `LabPanePage.jsx` has every step and its source.
5. **The pane opens only when the status read says Coder is reachable.** A
   frame from another origin cannot tell the page what it shows, so the page
   asks `GET /api/public/labs/coder-status`. Anything but configured and
   reachable, or a frame that has not loaded in 30 seconds, shows "Lab
   workspaces aren't available right now." and never the error.

Consequences of this amendment:

- **Two trust boundaries share a browser window, not an origin.** The frame
  is sandboxed and cross-origin, and Coder's GitHub sign-in stays the access
  control; #750's lock is a browsing rule.
- **The pane depends on the status read.** Until `CODER_URL` and
  `CODER_STATUS_TOKEN` resolve in the Function App, every pane says the
  workspaces are unavailable, even when Coder is up.
- **A workspace app that Coder opens in a new window or tab leaves the
  pane.** Found while building #751, from Coder v2.37.3's dashboard source:
  an app opens with `window.open` when its `open_in` is `slim-window`, the
  code-server module's default, or in a new tab when it is `tab`. Both are
  top-level visits, which #750 sends to the labs page. So in the pane a
  learner can sign in and create the workspace, and code-server's button
  opens nothing they can use. Opening code-server inside the pane is a
  lab-host change and is not made here (revisit triggers).
- **The site cannot tell whether a visitor is signed in**, because it cannot
  read the pane. The page shows the sign-in step until this browser has come
  back from one (for Coder's default 24-hour session), offers "I've already
  signed in", and keeps the sign-in button on the toolbar for an expired
  session. A visitor GitHub signs in but Coder refuses (outside the
  organisation) also lands back on the pane, which shows Coder's sign-in
  page again.

**Note, 2026-09-28: the lab launcher closes the code-server blocker.** The
third consequence above, code-server opening nothing a learner can use, is
resolved without loosening #750's lock. The pane now loads a small static
page on Coder's own name, `https://coder.lab.hybridcloudworks.com/_hcw/lab/?lab=<id>`
(`lab-host/coder/launcher/`, served by Caddy with a strict policy of its
own, `Cache-Control: no-store` and no top-level exemption, so a direct
visit still goes to `/education/labs`). With the learner's own Coder
session, GET only and same origin, it reads their workspace for that lab,
named from a fixed map the site's catalogue shares (`lab-lzb`, `lab-tfv`,
`lab-asc`). It shows Coder's own create page, with Coder's consent dialog,
or Coder's own workspace page, where Start is, in a frame of its own when
the learner must act. When the build is running, the agent ready and
code-server healthy, it checks that code-server's `subdomain_name` is
exactly the name Coder builds for that workspace and the signed-in
learner, and replaces itself with that name under a fixed suffix. code-server stays on its own
origin, and path apps stay off (`CODER_DISABLE_PATH_APPS`, #760).
`frame-src`, the sandbox and `allow` are unchanged. The launcher posts its
state to the site, which accepts it only from Coder's origin and the pane's
own window, and shows it on the toolbar. On the same day the pane stopped
depending on the status token: point 5's status read now says configured
with `CODER_URL` alone and reachable from Coder's unauthenticated
`/api/v2/buildinfo`, and the token adds only the card's templates and
running count, so the second consequence above no longer holds. Rejected on
the way (research against Coder v2.37.3): POSTs with a scraped CSRF token
(undocumented, and it skips Coder's consent), a launcher served as a path
app (a workspace's JavaScript on the dashboard's origin), rewriting Coder's
HTML in Caddy, and exempting same-site top-level visits (which would end
panes-only).

## Amendment 2026-09-29: Vault auto-unseal through the Arc identity

**Status: accepted by the owner on 2026-09-29, and live on the host.** The
owner accepted the trade stated below, the switch file was written, and the
owner ran the migration with three of the five keys. A restart then came back
unsealed with no keys typed: `vault status` read `Seal Type azurekeyvault`,
`Recovery Seal Type shamir` and `Sealed false`, and the journal said
`unsealed with stored key`. The five Shamir keys are now recovery keys. The
cold copy taken before the switch is `/root/vault-before-726.tgz` on the
host. As built, it takes effect on a host only when the owner writes
`/etc/ansible/facts.d/hcw_vault_seal.fact` there and runs the migration in
the [Labs host runbook](../runbooks/labs-host.md#hashicorp-vault-moving-to-auto-unseal),
and doing that is the acceptance of the trade stated below. Until then Vault
stays on the five Shamir keys, exactly as the amendment of 2026-09-26 left it.

**Context.** That amendment's item 3 leaves Vault sealed after every restart,
the 04:30 unattended-upgrades reboot included, until the owner enters three
keys, and names #726 as the way out. #726 asked first whether Vault's
`azurekeyvault` seal can sign in through the Arc agent's local identity
endpoint, or only through Azure VM IMDS, a client secret or workload
identity. Only the first keeps a secret off the host, and without it this
record would not take auto-unseal.

**The answer**, read against the source of the pinned release, Vault 2.1.1.
`go version -m` on the signature-checked binary lists exactly the module
versions below.

1. The seal (`go-kms-wrapping/wrappers/azurekeyvault` v2.0.14) signs in with
   a client secret only when `tenant_id`, `client_id` and `client_secret` are
   all set, and otherwise calls `azidentity.NewDefaultAzureCredential`.
   Verified in source.
2. That chain (`azidentity` v1.13.1) includes `ManagedIdentityCredential`,
   which hands managed identity to MSAL for Go v1.6.0. MSAL recognises an
   Arc machine from `IDENTITY_ENDPOINT` and `IMDS_ENDPOINT`, or from
   `/opt/azcmagent/bin/himds` existing, and runs the agent's challenge flow:
   a 401 naming a `.key` file in `/var/opt/azcmagent/tokens`, then the same
   request carrying that file's contents. The chain can be pinned to managed
   identity with `AZURE_TOKEN_CREDENTIALS=ManagedIdentityCredential`.
   Verified in source.
3. Microsoft documents the rest of the host side: the agent sets both
   variables in `/lib/systemd/system.conf.d/azcmagent.conf`, its daemon is
   `himdsd.service`, and "On Linux, you must be a member of the `himds`
   group" to read the challenge file. Verified on Microsoft Learn.
4. Arc has a system-assigned identity only. MSAL refuses a user-assigned one
   there ("Azure Arc doesn't support user-assigned managed identities"), and
   the seal turns a `client_id` into exactly that request, so the stanza
   carries none. Verified in source.
5. HashiCorp's seal page describes managed identity only "if Vault is hosted
   on Azure" and does not mention Arc. The path is supported by the code, not
   documented by HashiCorp: a Vault upgrade is a reason to read this again
   (revisit triggers).
6. End to end, in a container: the real 2.1.1 binary, running as `vault` with
   only the `himds` group added by its unit, answered the challenge of a
   stand-in for the agent, received a token, read the key from a stand-in for
   Key Vault, wrapped and unwrapped with it, migrated from Shamir and came
   back unsealed after a restart. That the real agent and Key Vault behave as
   the stand-ins do, which follow Microsoft's documented flow, is inferred;
   the owner's migration on the host is its proof.

**Decision, accepted 2026-09-29.**

1. **A lab-only vault, the Key Vault `kv-labhybrid-prod-cus-01`** in
   `rg-lab-hybrid-prod-cus` (`infra/lab-hybrid.tf`). Standard tier, RBAC
   authorisation, purge protection, `prevent_destroy`, and AuditEvent to the
   Management workspace. The name drops a hyphen because the pattern's
   `kv-lab-hybrid-prod-cus-01` is 25 characters and Key Vault allows 24.
2. **One key, `vault-seal`**: RSA 3072, software-protected, allowed
   `wrapKey` and `unwrapKey` only, with `prevent_destroy`. It is created
   through Resource Manager, which needs only
   `Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/keys/write` (Contributor has it), so the
   Terraform run identity holds no data-plane role on any vault.
3. **The Arc identity's only grant: Key Vault Crypto Service Encryption User
   on that key**, whose data actions are read, wrap and unwrap, and nothing
   on the vault or anywhere else. Terraform reads the Arc machine's principal
   at plan time and plans no grant while the machine does not exist, so a
   rebuilt host's new identity gets the grant at the next apply and the old
   one loses it.
4. **On the host, opt-in per installation.** The `vault` role adds a
   `seal "azurekeyvault"` stanza with no `client_id` and no secret, and the
   unit pins the credential chain to managed identity, joins `himds`, starts
   after the agent and retries every 30 seconds without a limit. The role
   reads the key as the Arc identity before it writes the stanza, and refuses
   to write a configuration without it while Vault's data is under it.
5. **Cost.** No monthly charge for a Standard vault or a software key; RSA
   3072 is an advanced key type at $0.15 per 10,000 operations (Azure Retail
   Prices API, Central US, read 2026-09-29). Vault's seal health check wraps
   and unwraps every 10 minutes while unsealed, about 8,800 operations a
   month, so about **$0.13 a month**. AuditEvent adds about 300 rows a day
   to the Management workspace, under a megabyte (estimated, not measured),
   inside its free 5 GB a month and well under 1% of its 0.25 GB daily cap.

**The trade, which is the owner's to accept.** With Shamir, root on this
host, which a workspace escape can reach, cannot unseal Vault: the root key
is split across keys only the owner holds. **With auto-unseal, root on the
host together with the Arc identity can.** Root can restart Vault and it
comes back unsealed, and a copy of the disk taken off the host, which holds
the agent's identity key as well as Vault's storage (the agent keeps that key
on the host unless the machine uses a TPM key store), can be unsealed for as
long as that identity keeps its grant. With Shamir, the same copy stays
sealed. What root gains that it does not already have is therefore narrow:
root can already read an unsealed Vault's memory, which the amendment of
2026-09-26 accepted, and Vault is unsealed nearly all the time. The
difference is the sealed window after a restart, and a disk copied away. The
boundary that makes this acceptable is unchanged: Vault holds lab-host
secrets only, never a production secret and nothing that exists nowhere
else, and the Arc identity reaches one key and nothing else. The detection
is the vault's audit log, where every unwrap carries the caller's IP
address. The revocation is removing the grant, or disconnecting the machine,
which deletes the identity. The price in availability is that Vault needs
Entra ID, Key Vault and the agent to start, and the recovery keys cannot
stand in for them, so an outage leaves Vault down until they answer, and a
deleted key would lose the Vault for good.

**Alternatives considered.**

- **A service principal and a client secret on the host.** Rejected: a
  stored secret root can read, and one more thing to rotate. It is what #726
  was opened to avoid.
- **Workload identity federation.** There is no token issuer on the host to
  federate, and Arc's identity is already the host's own credential.
- **Key Vault Crypto User, or a grant on the vault.** Rejected as wider than
  what Vault calls: Crypto User adds sign, verify, encrypt, decrypt, update
  and backup, and a vault-scope grant reaches any key added later.
- **An IP rule on the vault's firewall.** Not now. The host's address belongs
  to the `hcw-lab` workspace, which `infra/` never reads (decision 1), and a
  rule that drifted from it would leave Vault unable to unseal. Revisit
  trigger below.
- **A Premium vault and an HSM-backed key.** A monthly charge per key for a
  Vault that holds only secrets their issuers can issue again.
- **Keep Shamir.** The default, and what the host runs until the owner writes
  the fact.

**Consequences of this amendment, once the owner accepts it:**

- A restart, including the 04:30 reboot, comes back `Sealed false` with no
  owner step, and the five keys become recovery keys: still needed for
  `generate-root`, a rekey and a migration back, never again for an unseal.
- Every `hcw-azure` plan reads the Arc machine, and tolerates its absence.
- A rebuilt host starts without the seal, whatever the repository says; the
  owner writes the fact again after the next apply has moved the grant.
- Once the seal is on, `bootstrap.sh` must never run at a commit older than
  #726, whose role would write a configuration without it.

## Consequences and accepted risks

- **Two Terraform workspaces, two lifecycles.** A change to the lab host is a
  run in `hcw-lab` that the owner confirms in the HCP Terraform UI, the same
  way as `hcw-azure`. The isolation is the point, and it means the two can
  drift in provider versions and conventions; the
  [IaC repository standard](../standards/iac-repository-standard.md) applies to
  both.
- **No Kubernetes means no Kubernetes lab.** Followers who want AKS or k3s
  content will not get it from this host. Docker Compose is the whole
  orchestration story, and the host is rebuilt rather than repaired.
- **Arc adds an identity to the host.** The Arc agent's system-assigned
  identity can be granted Azure roles. This record grants it none beyond what
  the data collection rule needs; any grant is a change to `infra/` with its
  own review. (The amendment of 2026-09-29 made the first, in
  `infra/lab-hybrid.tf`: read, wrap and unwrap on one key in a lab-only Key
  Vault, never `kv-site-prod-cus-01`.)
- **Ingestion is bounded but not zero.** Heartbeat and auth syslog on one host
  are kilobytes a day against the workspace's 0.25 GB/day cap
  ([ADR 0031](0031-security-scanner-owner-decisions.md) records the headroom).
  A chatty `authpriv` source under an SSH brute-force attempt is the case to
  watch, and the daily-cap alert already exists.
- **Without Defender for Servers there is no managed EDR on the host.** The
  controls are SSH keys only, an inbound policy of 22, 80 and 443, audit-only
  machine configuration, and the auth syslog above. This is a stated cost
  trade, revisited in the triggers below.
- **Coder is a second identity system with its own users.** Learners have a
  GitHub-backed Coder account and nothing on the site. Coder's own hardening —
  workspace resource limits, template review, upgrade cadence — belongs to
  #659 and is not covered here.
- **Two processes can drive the Docker daemon, and daemon access is root on
  the host. Accepted, with the blast radius kept small on purpose.** (Three
  once the owner turns Portainer on; the amendment of 2026-09-26 bounds the
  third by who can reach it.) The
  Coder server container holds the socket; the `hcw-labs-agent` service is in
  the `docker` group. Whoever controls either controls the daemon, every
  workspace and every job container, so `--network none` and the label
  checks protect learners and jobs from each other, not the host from those
  two. The mitigations are: the socket goes to the Coder server only, never
  to a workspace (asserted by the #679 template test); workspaces run on
  their own bridge network with no route to the Compose network; the Coder
  server runs as a non-root user; the agent runs only the fixed argv
  templates in `vps-agent/lib/capabilities.js`, never a shell string shaped
  by a payload, with the payload bind-mounted read-only, and the API
  authorises every claim against the agent's registry document; and the host
  deliberately holds no data of record and no Azure or application
  credential: only the agent's certificate, which reaches three API
  endpoints, and Caddy's DNS token, which is scoped as narrowly as Cloudflare
  allows and which, in the interim the next bullet records, can edit
  production DNS records. That token is the one production-reaching
  credential on the host, and it is why the dedicated lab zone is the
  target shape. A compromise therefore costs a rebuild, plus a check of the
  production zone's records until that zone exists, not data. Moving workspaces and
  jobs to a rootless or separate daemon is a revisit trigger, not a
  prerequisite.

  *Amendment 2026-10-06 (estate review, LAB-5):* the Coder server no longer
  holds the socket. A `coder-docker-proxy` Compose service (HAProxy, one
  allow rule per Docker API section) mounts it read-only, and the server
  reaches the daemon through it over `DOCKER_HOST`: containers, images,
  networks, volumes and the lifecycle verbs the provisioner uses, and
  nothing else — no exec, build, commit, swarm, system or auth. A Coder
  vulnerability is now bounded to what the proxy allows rather than root.
  `template.test.mjs` asserts the mount, the allowlist and the absence of
  the socket and the docker group from the server. The agent keeps its
  docker group; its unit gained system-call and address-family filters and
  its `npm ci` runs with `--ignore-scripts`. Moving the agent to a rootless
  daemon stays the revisit trigger.
- **Cloudflare API tokens are zone-scoped, and `lab.hybridcloudworks.com` is
  a name in the production zone.** Cloudflare cannot scope a token to one
  record, so any token with DNS edit on `hybridcloudworks.com` can change the
  site's own records. Two tokens exist and neither is on the host in a form
  that reaches production DNS more than it must: the `hcw-lab` workspace
  token creates the `lab` records and lives only in HCP Terraform; Caddy's
  renewal token lives on the host in `/etc/caddy/env`, owner `root`, group
  `caddy`, mode `0640`, written from Ansible Vault and read by the non-root
  `caddy` service through its unit's `EnvironmentFile`, so the service can
  renew and nothing else on the host can read it. Caddy holds one certificate whose names are
  `lab.hybridcloudworks.com`, `*.lab.hybridcloudworks.com` and
  `*.coder.lab.hybridcloudworks.com` (Coder's workspace apps are one label
  below `coder.lab`, and a wildcard covers one label only). The chosen shape
  is **DNS-01 by CNAME delegation**: the two challenge names those SANs
  resolve to, `_acme-challenge.lab.hybridcloudworks.com` (for the apex and
  `*.lab`) and `_acme-challenge.coder.lab.hybridcloudworks.com` (for
  `*.coder.lab`), are CNAMEs into a dedicated lab zone that holds no
  production record, and Caddy's token is scoped to that zone alone. Until
  the owner has that zone (a small annual spend, tracked on #661), Caddy's
  token has DNS edit on the production zone, and that interim is an accepted
  risk recorded here rather than a surprise. *Corrected 2026-10-06 (estate
  review, LAB-1):* this bullet used to say the `hcw-azure` plan check and
  the deploy-drift monitor would show any production record the token
  altered. Neither does: the drift monitor reads GitHub only, the plan covers
  the three records Terraform manages, and the apex and `www` records are
  hand-made. The only record of a zone edit is Cloudflare's own audit log.
  Until the lab zone exists, the compensating steps are the token's
  client-IP filter and expiry in Cloudflare and an audit-log notification
  for DNS changes on the production zone, both owner steps.
- **`lab-image/` is a new supply-chain surface.** Every image it publishes
  must be digest-pinned where consumed, and the existing
  `capabilities.test.js` assertion that every capability names a digest is the
  gate. The Terraform provider mirror is a large image layer, and its pins are
  one more set to keep current.
- **The public path stays closed**, so the labs pages remain read-mostly until
  a revision of this record. That is deliberate: the rate limits above need a
  client identifier the anonymous site does not have yet, and choosing one
  (edge-hashed IP, signed cookie, or a Coder session) is the revision's job.
  (Revised 2026-09-28: the amendment of that date opens the path from the
  builder's pane and chooses the edge-hashed IP, made meaningful by a
  Turnstile token.)

## Alternatives considered

- **k3s on the host, with lab jobs as Kubernetes Jobs.** Rejected by the owner
  on 2026-09-24. It adds a control plane to run, patch and explain for one
  node, and turns "a VPS with Docker" — the thing a follower already has — into
  a distribution they must learn first. Docker's `--network none`, pids, memory
  and CPU limits already give the sandbox the isolation the runner needs.
- **A self-hosted GitHub Actions runner on the VPS**, for labs or for CI.
  Already rejected in [ADR 0025](0025-cosmos-firewall-datacenter-sentinel.md):
  this repository is public, and a self-hosted runner on a public repository
  lets a fork pull request execute code on the host.
  [ADR 0021 (number reused)](0021-container-apps-ci-runner.md) records the
  Container Apps form of the same idea and why it was dropped.
- **Managing the VPS by hand, or from Ansible alone.** Rejected. Without a
  Terraform record the host's plan, OS and DNS live in a control panel that no
  pull request can review, which is the state it was in when this record was
  written.
- **Putting the lab host in the `hcw-azure` workspace.** Rejected. It would let
  a provider error or a mistaken destroy in a lab experiment surface in the
  production run queue, and it needs the Hostinger token in the workspace that
  holds the production Azure credential.
- **Site-hosted learner sign-in** (a public Entra External ID or GitHub OAuth
  flow on the site itself). Rejected. [ADR 0006](0006-admin-identity.md) keeps
  the site's identity for administrators only, and Coder already has the
  learner sign-in the labs need.
- **Embedding Coder in the site** through an iframe. Rejected. It requires
  opening `frame-src` and `connect-src` to the lab origin, joins the two trust
  boundaries in the browser, and gives the learner a worse editor than the one
  Coder serves directly. (Chosen 2026-09-28, owner decision, #750 and #751:
  see the [amendment of that date](#amendment-2026-09-28-coder-in-the-sites-panes).
  Only `frame-src` had to open; `connect-src` did not.)
- **Defender for Servers Plan 1 on the Arc machine.** Rejected for now on
  cost (a per-server monthly charge for one host with no data of record). See
  the revisit triggers.
- **Opening public submission in this record**, with the bounds above.
  Deferred to a revision, for the client-identifier reason given under
  consequences. (The revision is the amendment of 2026-09-28.)
- **For that revision (2026-09-28), the origin alone.** Rejected: any script
  can send `Origin: https://hybridcloudworks.com`, so it locks out other
  sites' pages and nothing else.
- **For that revision, a signed session cookie from the site.** Rejected: the
  site has no anonymous session to sign, and minting one is a new token
  service to secure, rotate and explain, where Turnstile is a managed one the
  site's own proxy vendor already runs.
- **For that revision, a Coder session.** Rejected for the builder: it would
  make a learner sign in with GitHub to validate a download, and the builder
  is public by design. Coder stays the boundary for browser workspaces.
- **For that revision, the widget as `cloudflare_turnstile_widget` in
  `infra/`.** Rejected, for the state and token-scope reasons in item 6 of
  the amendment.

## Validation and revisit triggers

- **Validation:**
  - `hcw-lab` exists in the `hcw` organisation, is VCS-connected to this
    repository with working directory `infra-lab/`, has auto-apply off, and a
    plan there shows the VPS and DNS records. The `hcw-azure` workspace shows
    no change from the same commit.
  - After the owner applies, the host appears as **Connected** under Azure Arc
    > Machines in `rg-lab-hybrid-prod-cus`, and a `Heartbeat` query in the
    Management workspace returns rows for it.
  - The control plane is checked by name, not by count: `docker ps` on the
    host shows the Compose services `coder`, `coder-docker-proxy` and
    `coder-postgres` (and the
    container `portainer` while `portainer_enabled` is true), and
    `systemctl` shows `caddy`, `hcw-labs-agent` and `node-exporter` active as
    host-native units (and `vault` while `vault_enabled` is true). Every other container carries either the
    Coder workspace label (`com.coder.resource=true`) or the `hcw.lab-job`
    label the agent sets, and any container with neither is a finding. The
    count is not asserted, because a running workspace or job legitimately
    adds containers. `which kubectl k3s` returns nothing.
  - `/education/labs` shows the Arc status card fed by the Function App's
    Resource Graph read under its Reader grant on `rg-lab-hybrid-prod-cus`
    (decision 3), and shows an explicit absent state, not a fabricated one,
    when the resource group is missing or the host is down.
  - `enqueueLabJob` with no `Authorization` header still answers 401, which the
    Health Hub labs probe already asserts.
  - Since the amendment of 2026-09-28: `GET /api/public/labs/submit` answers
    `open: true` while `vps-hostinger-01` heartbeats, and a `POST` to it with
    no `Origin` header answers `403 ORIGIN_NOT_ALLOWED`. The builder's
    **Validate on the lab** at `https://hybridcloudworks.com/tools/landing-zone`
    queues a job that `vps-hostinger-01` claims and completes, and the page
    shows Terraform's output.
  - Every image `lab-image/` publishes is referenced by digest in
    `vps-agent/lib/capabilities.js` and the Coder template.
  - Since the amendment "Coder in the site's panes": with Coder enabled, a
    learner opens a lab from `/education/labs`, signs in with GitHub once in
    the tab the pane opens, and comes back to the lab's page with the
    workspace in the pane; a direct visit to
    `https://coder.lab.hybridcloudworks.com` still lands on
    `/education/labs`. Since the launcher note under it: after Coder's
    **Confirm and Create**, code-server opens inside the pane, and a direct
    visit to `https://coder.lab.hybridcloudworks.com/_hcw/lab/` also lands on
    `/education/labs`.
  - Since the amendment of 2026-09-29, accepted and live that day: on the
    host, `sudo systemctl restart vault && sleep 5 && vault status` shows
    `Seal Type azurekeyvault` and `Sealed false`, and `az role assignment
    list` on the key `vault-seal` returns one row, Key Vault Crypto Service
    Encryption User for the Arc machine's identity (the runbook's step 2).
- **Revisit when:**
  - Vault is upgraded past 2.1.x, which is a reason to read the seal's
    credential path again: signing in through the Arc agent is supported by
    the code, not documented by HashiCorp (amendment of 2026-09-29);
  - the Key Vault audit log shows an unwrap from an address that is not the
    lab host's, which is a revocation first (remove the grant) and a review
    of the auto-unseal trade second;
  - the lab host's public address becomes something `infra/` can read, which
    reopens an IP rule on `kv-labhybrid-prod-cus-01`;
  - the owner decides to open public submission, which is a revision of §6 of
    this record and nothing else (done 2026-09-28, the amendment of that
    date);
  - the daily cap fills from a handful of verified addresses, or siteverify
    passes tokens that the job pattern says were farmed, which reopens the
    lock (Turnstile's pre-clearance or interactive mode, or a signed
    session);
  - the host gains data of record (learner work that cannot be rebuilt), which
    reopens the backup posture and Defender for Servers;
  - the auth syslog shows sustained credential attacks, which reopens Defender
    for Servers and the inbound policy;
  - a second lab host is wanted, which reopens the single-workspace and
    single-Compose assumptions;
  - code-server is to open inside the pane rather than from Coder's app
    button, which leaves it (the amendment "Coder in the site's panes";
    done 2026-09-28 by the lab launcher, the note under that amendment);
  - the `hostinger/hostinger` provider changes its `hostinger_vps` resource
    incompatibly or is abandoned.
