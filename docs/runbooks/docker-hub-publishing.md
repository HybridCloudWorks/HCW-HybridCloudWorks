The lab images, `hcw-lab` and `hcw-lab-runner`, are published to Docker
Hub, under the organisation `hybridcloudworks`, on every push to `main`
that changes them. Docker Hub is their only registry. No Docker password,
personal access token or organisation access token is stored anywhere. GitHub Actions proves which workflow is running with its own OIDC
token, and Docker exchanges that for a Docker access token that lasts a few
minutes and is used once.

## What the workflow does

`publish-lab-image.yml`'s `publish` job runs only after `build` succeeds,
only from `main` (a push, a dispatch or the weekly rebuild), and only while
the repository variable `DOCKERHUB_ENABLED` is `true`:

1. Checks that `DOCKERHUB_CONNECTION` holds a connection ID (a UUID), before
   building anything, and fails with a message naming the variable if it
   does not.
2. Builds both targets, smoke-tests each, and runs the sandbox check.
3. Signs in to Docker Hub through the OIDC connection, with
   `docker/login-action` v4.6.0, asking for a token that lasts 900 seconds.
4. Pushes each image with `docker push`, tagged with the commit SHA and
   `latest`, and reads its digest back from Docker Hub.
5. Attests each image's provenance under its Docker Hub name, and pushes the
   attestation to Docker Hub beside the image.
6. Writes the two references, with their digests, to the run summary.

`propose-pins` then reads each digest again from Docker Hub by tag, and
`pin-pull-request` opens the pull request that moves the two consumers to
them.

## How the sign-in works

| Fact | Status and source |
| --- | --- |
| An OIDC connection is created in Docker Home: select the organisation, then **Identity & auth**, then **OIDC connections**, then **Create OIDC connection**. Rulesets and subject claims are required, and "Other values are optional". The connection ID is copied after **Create connection**. | VERIFIED: [Create and manage OIDC connections](https://docs.docker.com/security/authentication/oidc-connections/create-manage/) |
| Only organisation owners and editors can create one. | VERIFIED: same page, "Organization owners and editors create and manage OIDC connections"; [core roles](https://docs.docker.com/security/roles-and-permissions/core-roles/) lists "Manage OIDC connections" for editor and owner, not member |
| GitHub is the only supported issuer. | VERIFIED: same page, "OIDC connections support only GitHub as a trusted third party." |
| The feature needs a Docker Team, Business or Hardened Images subscription, or the Docker-Sponsored Open Source programme. | VERIFIED: [Docker's announcement, 2026-07-31](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-oidc-connections-for-github-actions-available-for-docker-orgs/); the docs' summary bar reads `subscription: [Team, Business]`. **Whether `hybridcloudworks` qualifies is NOT VERIFIED**: its plan is visible only when signed in. See "Before you start" |
| A ruleset has a label, rules (subject claim strings), resources (Docker Hub repositories or Docker Build Cloud) and scopes ("such as read or write access"). There can be 1 to 5 rulesets, and when several match, their resources are merged. | VERIFIED: [Rulesets and subject claims](https://docs.docker.com/security/authentication/oidc-connections/rulesets-claims/) |

| The exact on-screen labels for resources and scopes. | NOT VERIFIED: the form is behind sign-in, and Docker's pages describe the fields without naming the controls |
| `docker/login-action` added Docker Hub OIDC in v4.5.0. This repository pins v4.6.0 (`dbcb8138…`). The workflow grants `id-token: write`, passes the organisation name as `username`, omits `password`, and sets `DOCKERHUB_OIDC_CONNECTIONID`. | VERIFIED: [v4.5.0 release notes](https://github.com/docker/login-action/releases/tag/v4.5.0); the [README at v4.6.0](https://github.com/docker/login-action/blob/v4.6.0/README.md#docker-hub) |
| The exchange: the action requests a GitHub ID token with the audience `https://identity.docker.com`, then posts it to `https://identity.docker.com/oauth/token` as an RFC 8693 token exchange (`grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange`, `subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token`, plus `connection_id` and `expires_in`). It masks the returned access token and runs `docker login` with it. `expires_in` defaults to 300 seconds; the environment variable `DOCKERHUB_OIDC_EXPIREIN` accepts 300 to 3600. | VERIFIED: [`src/dockerhub.ts` at v4.6.0](https://github.com/docker/login-action/blob/v4.6.0/src/dockerhub.ts). `DOCKERHUB_OIDC_EXPIREIN` is in the source, not the README. The workflow sets it to 900 since 2026-10-08, when the login moved in front of full pushes |
| This repository's OIDC subject uses GitHub's immutable-identifier form: `repo:saulpatinojr@34853639/HCW-HybridCloudWorks@1268997852:ref:refs/heads/main` on `main`. | VERIFIED: `GET /repos/saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks/actions/oidc/customization/sub` returned `use_immutable_subject: true` and that prefix on 2026-10-08, and the failing Azure logins after the transfer presented the same subject. Before 2026-10-07 the owner half was `HybridCloudWorks@312844660` (same call, 2026-09-28). Docker's rulesets page notes the immutable form |
| Until 2026-10-08, when the copy step went: a single-image copy keeps its digest only with `--prefer-index=false`. | VERIFIED by measurement, 2026-09-28, buildx v0.37.1 (the runner's version): `ghcr.io/hybridcloudworks/hcw-lab-runner@sha256:c02d87ac…` copied to a local registry kept `sha256:c02d87ac…`. Without the flag, buildx wraps the image in a new manifest list with a new digest. [imagetools create reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/buildx/imagetools/create/) |
| Until 2026-10-08: the copy does not carry GHCR's attestation across. | VERIFIED by the same measurement: the destination had no attestation tag afterwards |
| `actions/attest` pushes to Docker Hub when the subject name uses `docker.io` as its registry part. | VERIFIED: [actions/attest README](https://github.com/actions/attest#container-image), "When pushing to Docker Hub, please use "docker.io" as the registry portion of the image name." |
| A `docker push` to a missing repository creates it with the namespace's default privacy. | VERIFIED: [Docker Hub settings](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/settings/#configure-default-repository-privacy). Not relied on: both repositories already exist and are public |

## Before you start

- **You are an owner or editor of `hybridcloudworks` on Docker.**
- **The organisation's subscription allows OIDC connections.** Team,
  Business, Hardened Images, or acceptance into Docker-Sponsored Open Source
  (#678). If step 1 shows an upgrade prompt instead of the form, or refuses
  **Create connection**, stop there. Nothing in the repository needs
  changing: the publish job stays skipped until `DOCKERHUB_ENABLED` is
  set, and nothing is published anywhere.
- **The repositories exist.** They do (see the status note above). If one is
  ever deleted, recreate it as **Public** at
  <https://hub.docker.com/orgs/hybridcloudworks/repositories>, because a
  ruleset can only name a repository that exists.

## 1. Create the OIDC connection in Docker Home

Open <https://app.docker.com/>, choose **hybridcloudworks** in the
organisation switcher at the top left, then select **Identity & auth** and
**OIDC connections**. That is the page with the empty list and the
**Create OIDC connection** button. Docker Home is behind sign-in, so its
address for that page could not be read from outside it. Once you are on
the page, the address bar holds the deep link.

Select **Create OIDC connection** and fill the form with exactly these
values. Add no second ruleset.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name or description, if the form offers one (optional) | `github-hcw-publish-lab-image` |
| Ruleset label | `publish-lab-image-main` |
| Rule (subject claim) | `repo:saulpatinojr@34853639/HCW-HybridCloudWorks@1268997852:ref:refs/heads/main` |
| Resources | Docker Hub repositories `hybridcloudworks/hcw-lab` and `hybridcloudworks/hcw-lab-runner`, those two only, not all repositories |
| Scopes | Read and write (push) on both. The job reads each repository back after writing to it |

Select **Create connection**, then copy the connection ID it shows. It looks
like `3f0c…` in five hyphenated groups of hex digits (a UUID). The ID is an
identifier, not a credential: without a token from this repository's `main`
it grants nothing.

Why this subject, and only this one:

- **The immutable form, because it is the one GitHub presents.** The subject
  carries the owner's and repository's numeric IDs, so a future account or
  repository that takes the name `saulpatinojr` or `HCW-HybridCloudWorks`
  cannot match it. The name form, `repo:saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks:ref:refs/heads/main`,
  is not what this repository's tokens carry, and adding it would only widen
  the connection.
- **`ref:refs/heads/main`, not an environment.** The job runs only on a push
  to `main` or a dispatch from `main`. A subject ending in
  `:environment:<name>` carries no branch, so it would match a dispatch from
  any branch unless a deployment-branch rule held
  ([Required inputs](../standards/required-inputs.md), §4.4). A pull request
  presents `:pull_request` and matches nothing here.
- **No wildcard.** A wildcard such as `repo:saulpatinojr@34853639/*`
  would admit every repository the account owns.

Every workflow on `main` presents this same subject, so a job elsewhere in
the repository could also exchange a token if it named the connection ID.
Reaching `main` needs a reviewed pull request past the ruleset's required
checks, and that is the boundary this relies on. Scoping by workflow as well
would need a custom subject template for the whole repository, which would
break every Azure federated credential in `infra/oidc.tf`.

## 2. Store the connection ID as a repository variable

Run this in PowerShell and, at the prompt, paste the connection ID from
step 1. It asks rather than reading the clipboard, because copying this line
from the page replaces whatever the clipboard held. It refuses anything that
is not a UUID and sets `DOCKERHUB_CONNECTION`:

```powershell
$id = (Read-Host 'Docker OIDC connection ID').Trim(); if ($id -match '^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$') { gh variable set DOCKERHUB_CONNECTION --repo saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks --body $id } else { "That is not a connection ID (a UUID). It was: $id" }
```

Success prints `✓ Created variable DOCKERHUB_CONNECTION for saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks`
(`Updated` if it existed). A variable, not a secret, because it is an
identifier: GitHub shows it in logs, which is what makes a wrong one
diagnosable.

## 3. Turn the job on

```powershell
gh variable set DOCKERHUB_ENABLED --repo saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks --body true
```

Set the ID first and this second, so no run ever sees the switch on without
an ID. To read both back:

```powershell
gh variable get DOCKERHUB_CONNECTION --repo saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks; gh variable get DOCKERHUB_ENABLED --repo saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks
```

It prints the UUID, then `true`.

## 4. Publish

The next push to `main` that changes the lab image publishes to Docker Hub
on its own. To publish now, dispatch the workflow from `main`. The dispatch
rebuilds and smoke-tests both images before it pushes them, which is what
the workflow always does:

```powershell
gh workflow run publish-lab-image.yml --repo saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks --ref main
```

A few seconds later, once the run has appeared, follow it. This prints each
job as it finishes, and exits non-zero if the run fails:

```powershell
gh run watch (gh run list --repo saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks --workflow publish-lab-image.yml --event workflow_dispatch --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId') --repo saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks --exit-status
```

The run is also listed at
<https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks/actions/workflows/publish-lab-image.yml>.

## What success looks like

- **The run:** `Build and smoke`, `Publish to Docker Hub` and `Plan the
  consumers' digest pins` green, and `Open or update the digest pull
  request` too when the digests moved. The summary has a `Published` block
  with the two `docker.io/hybridcloudworks/…` references and their digests.
- **Docker Hub:** <https://hub.docker.com/r/hybridcloudworks/hcw-lab/tags>
  and <https://hub.docker.com/r/hybridcloudworks/hcw-lab-runner/tags> each
  list `latest` and the commit's full SHA as tags.
- **The published bytes, anonymously.** These read the digest Docker Hub
  serves for `latest` and pull exactly it, with no sign-in. Each digest
  printed should equal the one in the run's `Published` block:

  ```powershell
  $d = docker buildx imagetools inspect docker.io/hybridcloudworks/hcw-lab:latest --format '{{.Manifest.Digest}}'; $d; docker pull "hybridcloudworks/hcw-lab@$d"
  ```

  ```powershell
  $r = docker buildx imagetools inspect docker.io/hybridcloudworks/hcw-lab-runner:latest --format '{{.Manifest.Digest}}'; $r; docker pull "hybridcloudworks/hcw-lab-runner@$r"
  ```

  Each ends with a `Digest: sha256:…` line and `Status: Downloaded newer image for …`,
  or `Image is up to date`.
- **The provenance.** This reads the attestation stored on Docker Hub, not
  the copy in GitHub's API, and prints `✓ Verification succeeded!`, naming
  `.github/workflows/publish-lab-image.yml@refs/heads/main`:

  ```powershell
  gh attestation verify oci://docker.io/hybridcloudworks/hcw-lab:latest --repo saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks --bundle-from-oci
  ```

  The same command against `ghcr.io/hybridcloudworks/hcw-lab:latest`
  succeeded on 2026-09-28. The first publish after 2026-10-08 is the
  baseline for the Docker Hub-only form.

## When it fails

| Where, and what it says | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Publish to Docker Hub` shows as skipped | `DOCKERHUB_ENABLED` is not `true` | Step 3 |
| `DOCKERHUB_CONNECTION holds a connection ID`: `DOCKERHUB_ENABLED is true, but the repository variable DOCKERHUB_CONNECTION is not an OIDC connection ID` | The variable is missing or holds something else | Step 2 |
| `Log in to Docker Hub through the OIDC connection`: `Docker Hub API: bad status code 4xx: {…}` | Docker refused the exchange. Usually the subject did not match the ruleset, or the connection is deactivated or was deleted | The run's summary has a table, **Docker refused the token exchange**, from the step `Explain a refused Docker token exchange`. It shows the token's `sub`, `aud`, `ref` and `repository` claims (never the token) and says whether `sub` equals the rule in step 1. Then open the connection's **Edit** page in Docker Home: its **Failures** table shows each refused exchange and why. A subject mismatch means the rule is not exactly the one in step 1. A deleted connection needs a new one, and its new ID in step 2. The first real run, 36508154993 on 2026-09-29, failed here with `400 {"error":"access_denied"}` |
| The same step: `Docker Hub API: operation not permitted` | A 401 with no body from Docker | As above |
| A push or attest step: `unauthorized`, `insufficient_scope` or `requested access to the resource is denied` | The ruleset's resources or scopes do not include push on that repository | Edit the ruleset: both repositories, read and write |
| A push or attest step fails as unauthorized many minutes after the login succeeded | The Docker token expired (the workflow asks for 900 seconds) | Re-run the failed job. If it keeps happening, raise `DOCKERHUB_OIDC_EXPIREIN` on the login step (at most 3600), a pull request |
| **Create connection** refused, or an upgrade prompt in step 1 | The organisation's subscription does not include OIDC connections | "Before you start" |

## After a repository transfer

The subject names the GitHub account that owns the repository, with its
numeric ID. Moving the repository to another account replaces both, even
though the repository's own ID stays the same. The Docker organisation
`hybridcloudworks` and its two repositories do not move, so the connection
keeps its ID and its resources. Only the rule needs changing.

1. Open the connection in Docker Home (step 1 gives the route) and select
   **Edit**.
2. In the ruleset `publish-lab-image-main`, replace the rule with the value
   in step 1. It must match exactly: there is no wildcard, and the old rule
   should not stay beside the new one, because nothing can present it any
   more.
3. Save. The repository variables from steps 2 and 3 travel with the
   repository and keep their values (`DOCKERHUB_CONNECTION` and
   `DOCKERHUB_ENABLED` were both present after the 2026-10-07 move). Their
   commands above name the current owner.
4. Publish (step 4) and check "What success looks like".

`EXPECTED_RULE` in `publish-lab-image.yml` holds the same string, and
`scripts/check-oidc-owner.mjs` checks it against `infra/oidc.tf` and
against the repository CI runs in. A transfer therefore fails a pull request
before it fails a publish. It cannot reach Docker Home, so this edit stays a
manual step.

Done once already: on 2026-10-07 the repository moved from the
`HybridCloudWorks` organisation (owner ID `312844660`) to the personal account
`saulpatinojr` (`34853639`).

## Turning it off

This stops publishing the lab images altogether, since Docker Hub is their
only registry:

```powershell
gh variable set DOCKERHUB_ENABLED --repo saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks --body false
```

In Docker Home, **Deactivate** on the connection's row pauses it too, but
then the job runs and fails at the login step. Setting the variable to
`false` is the quiet way. Images already on Docker Hub stay there.

## Why not an organisation access token

Docker's organisation access tokens work with `docker/login-action` today,
but one would sit in a GitHub secret until someone rotates it, with no tie
to a repository, a branch or a workflow. The OIDC connection stores nothing,
matches one subject, and issues a token that expires minutes after the run
asks for it. That is the same reasoning that keeps every Azure login in this
repository on federated credentials
([Variables and secrets](../standards/variables-and-secrets.md), "Why OIDC
federation means zero long-lived cloud credentials in GitHub").

## Since it went live

- **The site:** `LAB_IMAGE` in `frontend/src/data/labs/catalogue.js`, which
  drives the `/education/labs` "Run it locally" commands, names
  `hybridcloudworks/hcw-lab:latest` on Docker Hub (#795).
- **#779:** closed on 2026-09-29, after the three checks under "What success
  looks like" passed.
- **2026-10-07, repository transfer:** the rule in step 1, `EXPECTED_RULE`
  and the commands in step 4 moved to the `saulpatinojr` owner. The
  connection's rule in Docker Home is edited by hand, as in "After a
  repository transfer". Images attested before the move were signed by the
  workflow under its old owner. Whether `gh attestation verify --repo
  saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks` accepts those is NOT VERIFIED. The
  first publish after the move gives a `latest` that was signed under the
  new owner.
- **2026-10-08, Docker Hub only:** the first publish after the transfer
  failed at the GHCR push with `permission_denied: The requested
  installation does not exist` (run 37730460748). The repository's token
  can no longer write the organisation's package namespace, and the owner
  chose one registry over two. `publish` now pushes straight to Docker Hub
  through this connection, the separate copy job is gone, and the two
  consumers (`vps-agent/lib/capabilities.js` and the Coder template) pin
  `docker.io/hybridcloudworks/…`. The digests pinned that day were already
  on Docker Hub byte for byte, so nothing was rebuilt for the move. The
  lab host's `lab_images` role still removes images under the former
  `ghcr.io/hybridcloudworks/hcw-lab*` once no pin names them. The images
  already on GHCR stay there, public and frozen. The section that copied
  GHCR's images to Docker Hub by hand before the connection existed went
  with it, since there is no GHCR copy to read from any more.
