# Admin sign-in rollback

**What this is for:** nobody can sign in to `/admin`, and you want the previous
Entra configuration back. The public site is unaffected by everything on this
page — it is anonymous and does not touch Entra.

**Time:** about five minutes, most of it the frontend deploy.

---

## First: is it actually the configuration?

Do not roll anything back until the portal has told you what is wrong. Admin →
Health decodes the caller's own token in the browser and compares it against
what the API reports it enforces, so it distinguishes the cases that look
identical from outside.

Open <https://hybridcloudworks.com/admin/health> and read the **Token claims**
card.

| What you see | What it means | Roll back? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aud` verdict FAIL | The token is for a different API than the one validating it | **Yes** — configuration |
| `azp` equals `aud` | One registration is serving both halves again | **Yes** — the variable has reverted |
| Delegated scope FAIL | The SPA is requesting the wrong scope | **Yes** — configuration |
| App Role FAIL, registry says not admin | An assignment was removed | **No** — re-assign the role |
| "Could not verify your access" | The check did not run | **No** — read the message; a session problem is not a configuration one |
| Everything PASS but a feature errors | Not sign-in at all | **No** |

If you cannot reach Health because sign-in itself fails, the browser console
carries the reason — `AuthCallbackPage` logs it there deliberately rather than
rendering it.

## The rollback, in order

The order matters. Step 1 is what makes step 2 work; doing them the other way
round produces a deploy that cannot complete a sign-in.

### 1. Restore the redirect URIs on the API registration

**Only needed when rolling back to the API app id.** They were cleared on
2026-09-12 once the split was verified, so they are not there now — and a
frontend pointed at that registration would fail at the redirect.

This step cannot be a workflow. The GitHub deploy identity is a user-assigned
managed identity holding Azure RBAC and no Entra directory rights, deliberately:
`infra/oidc.tf` explains that Azure Owner does not grant the ability to write an
app registration, and granting CI Application Administrator so a rollback is one
click would hand every future workflow run that power permanently. It needs a
human with directory permission.

PowerShell, signed in as Application Administrator, Cloud Application
Administrator or Global Administrator:

```powershell
./scripts/rollback/restore-admin-signin.ps1 -WhatIf
```

```powershell
./scripts/rollback/restore-admin-signin.ps1
```

The script holds the tenant and application identifiers — they are parameter
defaults there rather than in this page, because the docs redaction gate rejects
real GUIDs under `docs/` and the working agreement rejects placeholders in a
line meant to be pasted. Putting them in the script satisfies both.

It reads the registration back after writing, so a PATCH that silently did
nothing fails here rather than three steps later. **It prints the client id to
use in step 2.**

### 2. Deploy the frontend with the old client id

<https://github.com/HybridCloudWorks/HCW-HybridCloudWorks/actions/workflows/deploy-azure-frontend.yml>

**Run workflow** → set **`entra_client_id_override`** to the client id step 1
printed. Leave everything else alone.

The run logs a warning naming the id it built with, so what happened is recorded
in the run rather than in somebody's memory. The build still validates it:
`assertDeployConfig` refuses anything that is not a GUID, so a mistyped id fails
the build instead of shipping a sign-in that cannot work.

**This does not persist.** The override applies to that build only; the next
deploy reads `VITE_ENTRA_CLIENT_ID` again. That is deliberate — an emergency
should not silently become the configuration — but it means an ordinary deploy
would undo the rollback without anyone intending it.

### 3. Make it permanent, or undo it

Once the incident is over, one of these:

- **Keeping the rollback:** set the `VITE_ENTRA_CLIENT_ID` repository variable to
  the same id step 1 printed, and reopen
  [#522](https://github.com/HybridCloudWorks/HCW-HybridCloudWorks/issues/522) —
  the split is then undone and ADR 0006 no longer matches the tenant, which is
  the state that whole issue existed to end.
- **Going forward again:** fix the cause, dispatch a normal deploy with the
  input blank, and re-clear the API registration's redirect URIs (the command is
  in [#530](https://github.com/HybridCloudWorks/HCW-HybridCloudWorks/pull/530)).

---

## Verifying the rollback worked

Sign in from a clean browser profile, then Admin → Health:

- `aud` is unchanged either way — it is the API, and a rollback does not move it.
- `azp` is now **equal to** `aud`. That is the tell: one registration is serving
  both halves again, which is what the rollback restores.
- The verdict **"`azp` differs from `aud`"** will read **FAIL**, correctly. On a
  rolled-back configuration that is the expected state, not a new problem.
- Everything else — scope, tenant, token version, App Role, registry — should
  still PASS. If any of those fail, the rollback is not the fix and step 1 of
  this page applies again.

---

## What this page does not cover

**The API.** Nothing here touches the Function App or its token validation.
`ENTRA_API_AUDIENCE` is the API's own client id and does not change in either
direction — if you find yourself editing it during a rollback, stop, because
that is not what broke.

**A functions rollback.** Different workflow, different runbook: revert the
commit and dispatch `deploy-functions.yml`.

**Entra being down.** If sign-in fails because Microsoft is failing, none of this
helps and the only thing to do is wait. Health's "Could not verify your access"
card is the distinction: a configuration problem names a claim, an outage does
not.
