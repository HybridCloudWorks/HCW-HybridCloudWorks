# Security scanner triage

One row per finding the security scanners reported on `main` at `357114f4`
(after #565), with the verdict, the evidence, and what resolves it. Issue
[#567](https://github.com/HybridCloudWorks/HCW-HybridCloudWorks/issues/567).

A suppression in a scanner's own file, or in an inline comment, points back to
the section of this page it belongs to. **A new suppression needs a new row
here first.** Anything paid or irreversible stays unsilenced until the owner
decides. The owner decided the last of them on 2026-09-14; see
[Owner decisions 2026-09-14](#owner-decisions-2026-09-14).

## Counts

Qlty CLI 0.644.0, `qlty check --all --filter <plugin> --no-formatters`, run
locally on 2026-09-14. zizmor (1.30.1) also runs directly, and its counts agree:

```bash
uvx zizmor --offline .github/workflows
```

| Scanner | Before | Fixed | False positive | Accepted | Needs owner decision | After |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| zizmor | 42 | 42 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** |
| checkov | 38 | 8 | 12 | 18 | 0 | **0** |

| trufflehog | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** |
| **Total** | **121** | **54** | **42** | **25** | **0** | **19** |

Corrected 2026-09-18: zizmor's "Before" was 36, counting only the regular and
pedantic personas. Six medium `secrets-outside-env` findings stood at the
**auditor** persona and had never been triaged, which the 2026-09-16
verification comment on #567 missed. They are fixed and the row now reads 42.
A persona is not a severity filter — run all three.

What "After" still counts:

- **checkov and trivy 0.** The owner decided every paid or irreversible row
  on 2026-09-14 ([ADR 0031](../decisions/0031-security-scanner-owner-decisions.md)): real changes where the answer was yes,
  inline skips citing that record where it was no. See
  [Owner decisions 2026-09-14](#owner-decisions-2026-09-14). checkov counts 38,
  not 36: Qlty Cloud also reported the two CKV_GHA_7 rows added below, which
  the local run had not.
- **radarlint-iac 19** are false positives, and the one place that can
  silence them is `.qlty/qlty.toml`, which #568 (PR #581) owns. The rule to
  add is in [radarlint-iac](#radarlint-iac).

Verdicts:

- **Fixed:** changed in this PR, so the scanner no longer reports it.
- **False positive:** the scanner is wrong about the code, with the evidence.
- **Accepted:** the scanner is right about the shape, and the risk is taken on
  purpose, either under a recorded owner decision or for the reason given.
- **Needs owner decision:** a real gap whose fix costs money or cannot be
  undone. Nothing in Terraform changes until the owner decides.

### artipacked (19, medium): fixed

`actions/checkout` writes the job's `GITHUB_TOKEN` into `.git/config`, where
any later step, or an uploaded artifact that includes the workspace, can read
it. Each checkout now sets `persist-credentials: false`.

Every job was checked for a later step that needs the persisted credential:
`git push`, `git fetch`/`pull`, `gh` driven by the checkout credential,
`EndBug/add-and-commit`, `peter-evans/*`. None was found. The `git diff`
calls in `ci.yml`, `codeql.yml` and `iac-validate.yml` read the local clone
(`fetch-depth: 0`), and need no credential. The two jobs that do push
(`publish-content-manifest.yml` and `update-learn-catalogue.yml`, second
job each) already used `persist-credentials: false` and push with an app token.

### template-injection (17, informational): fixed

All 17 were in `deploy-functions.yml`: repository variables
(`vars.RESOURCE_GROUP`, `vars.FUNCTIONS_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`,
`vars.FUNCTION_APP_NAME`, `vars.APP_HOSTNAME`, `vars.FUNCTIONS_URL`) and one
step output (`steps.fw.outputs.runner_ip`, the runner's public IP as an
external service reported it), expanded inside `run:`. They now reach the
script through step `env:` as `RG`, `SA`, `APP`, `RUNNER_IP`, `APP_HOSTNAME`
and `FUNCTIONS_URL`, the names the other steps in that file already use. The
unflagged `${{ github.run_id }}` in the same steps is now the runner's
`GITHUB_RUN_ID`, so no `${{ }}` is left in those scripts. The commands run
with the same values.

### unpinned-uses (#562): not reproduced

zizmor reports no `unpinned-uses`. All 62 `uses:` lines in every tracked YAML
file are pinned to a 40-character commit SHA. That covers the workflows,
`copilot-setup-steps.yml` and the rest of `.github/`. The repository has no
composite actions (no `action.yml` or `action.yaml`). Closes #562.

### secrets-outside-env (6, medium, auditor persona): fixed

**These were missed until 2026-09-18.** The 2026-09-16 verification comment on
#567 reported zero findings at all three personas; it was wrong about the
auditor persona, where six mediums stood. The counts table below is corrected.

| Workflow | Job | Secret | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `publish-content-manifest.yml` | `commit` | `MANIFEST_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (×2) | fixed |
| `update-learn-catalogue.yml` | `commit` | `MANIFEST_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (×2) | fixed |
| `tfc-plan-check.yml` | `check` | `TFC_TOKEN` (×2) | fixed |

zizmor's auditor persona reports a secret read by a job that belongs to no
GitHub Environment. The remediation is to declare one, and all three jobs now
declare `environment: automation`.

**This was never a new decision.** The estate already scopes every other
secret-using job: `production` on `deploy-functions.yml` and
`deploy-azure-frontend.yml`, `copilot` on `copilot-setup-steps.yml`,
`github-pages` on `docs-pages.yml`. These three were the ones that never
adopted the convention the owner had already applied four times.

It is also what Microsoft asks for. **MCSB v2 DS-3** (*Secure the DevOps
infrastructure*, criticality **Must have**) requires "repository-level service
connection restrictions preventing pipelines from accessing secrets outside
their intended scope", and the `azure/login` guidance states the property
plainly: "use environment secrets instead of repository secrets. If the
environment requires approval, a job cannot access environment secrets until
one of the required reviewers approves it."

**Why `automation` and not `production`.** These jobs open pull requests and
read a Terraform plan; they do not deploy. Two of the three are scheduled, so
inheriting a production approval gate would leave a scheduled run waiting on a
human who is not there.

**No OIDC subject changed.** `infra/oidc.tf` records that declaring an
environment rewrites the OIDC subject, and that a stale federated credential
fails with `AADSTS700213`. That hazard applies to jobs which exchange a token —
none of these three calls `azure/login`. The one job in these files that does
(`build` in `publish-content-manifest.yml`) was never flagged and is untouched.

**The remaining half is the owner's, and the order is load-bearing.**
Declaring the environment changes nothing by itself: a repository secret stays
readable from a job in any environment. The control arrives when the secret
becomes an *environment* secret on `automation`.

Each of these three jobs self-arms — an absent secret makes it report "not set
— skipping" and pass **green**. So the order is load-bearing, and only one
order is safe:

1. **This PR first.** A job that declares an environment can still read a
   REPOSITORY secret — environment secrets *override* repository ones, which
   is only meaningful because the repository one would otherwise be readable.
   So declaring `automation` while the secret sits at repository level changes
   nothing and breaks nothing.
2. **The secret moves second.** By then the job names the environment, so it
   resolves.

The reverse is the trap: move the secret to `automation` while the job has no
`environment:` key and it resolves EMPTY. The job then reports "not set —
skipping" and passes green while the automation is dead — the #630 shape, a
silent no-op behind a passing check.

Stated explicitly because the opposite order is an easy and costly thing to
assume. See [Owner follow-up](#owner-follow-up-2026-09-18).

**On zizmor's own view of this rule.** Since 1.24.0 `secrets-outside-env` is
auditor-persona only, because the remediation has platform sharp edges — most
notably that environment secrets do not reach reusable workflows unless the
caller passes `secrets: inherit`. That caveat does not apply here: none of
these three workflows is called through `workflow_call`. zizmor also cannot
see where a secret is actually stored, so it will report this clear once the
`environment:` key exists whether or not step 2 ever happens. The key is the
evidence that step 2 is possible, not that it was done.

### TFC_TOKEN has no OIDC alternative

Worth recording so nobody re-researches it. HCP Terraform's API accepts a
bearer API token and nothing else — there is no GitHub-OIDC path to
`app.terraform.io/api/v2`. Three things are mistaken for one and none replaces
`TFC_TOKEN`: *dynamic provider credentials* federate a Terraform **run** into
Azure (the other direction), *HCP workload identity federation* mints an HCP
**platform** token for HCP services, and *VCS-driven runs* remove CI from the
path rather than federating it.

The controls that do apply are scope, expiry and placement, and they are owner
actions:

- A **team** token, not a user token (dies with the person) or an organization
  token (owner-equivalent). `tfc-plan-check.yml`'s header already says a user
  or team token with workspace admin is required.
- An **expiration**, with rotation on it. HCP Terraform warns at 30 and 7 days
  and allows concurrent team tokens, so rotation needs no outage window.
- `deploy-functions.yml` reads `TFC_TOKEN` inside a job that already declares
  `environment: production`, so an environment secret there would override the
  repository one and put the deploy-path token behind that gate.

## Owner follow-up 2026-09-18

Nothing below is reachable from this repository; each is a change in GitHub or
HCP Terraform settings.

1. **Create the `automation` environment** — it is created implicitly the first
   time a workflow referencing it runs, so this is only needed to set rules on
   it. **Do not add required reviewers**: `publish-content-manifest.yml` and
   `update-learn-catalogue.yml` are scheduled, and an approval gate would leave
   those runs waiting rather than failing. A branch restriction is the useful
   rule here.
2. **Move `MANIFEST_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` and `TFC_TOKEN`** from repository secrets
   to `automation` environment secrets — **after** this PR merges, never
   before, for the silent-green reason above.
3. **`TFC_TOKEN` hygiene** — team token, with an expiry, as above.

## checkov

Inline suppressions are `#checkov:skip=RULE:reason` on the Terraform resource,
or `# checkov:skip=RULE:reason` (YAML comment spacing) on the
`workflow_dispatch:` key of the workflow. Checkov accepts both spellings. The one repository-wide skip is in
`.checkov.yaml`, with its reason.

### workflow_dispatch inputs, CKV_GHA_7 (8): 6 accepted, 2 fixed

CKV_GHA_7 is a SLSA build-integrity rule: "workflow_dispatch inputs MUST be
empty". None of these workflows builds a release artifact from its inputs, and
every input reaches its script only through `env:`, never through `${{ }}`
inside `run:`. Only people with write access can dispatch a workflow.

| AZU-0058 | `infra/storage.tf` | Fixed | Host storage is GRS. Same change as checkov CKV_AZURE_206. | 2026-09-14 |

Two trivy ignores on one resource must sit on consecutive lines directly above
it. A comment line between them drops the upper one, as found locally with
trivy 0.69.2.

## bandit

Developer tooling that Claude Code runs on the owner's machine and that CI
smoke-tests (`ci.yml`, harness job). No argument comes from outside the
repository.

| Rule | File:line | Verdict | Reason and evidence | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B404 | `hooks/claude_event.py:14` | Accepted | Importing `subprocess` is the finding. Every call below it uses a list argv and never `shell=True`. | `# nosec B404` with the reason, this PR |
| B607 | `hooks/claude_event.py:30` | Fixed | `git` was resolved from `PATH` at call time. It is now resolved once with `shutil.which("git")` and passed as an absolute path. When git is missing, the hook takes the existing no-git fallback. | This PR |
| B603 | `hooks/claude_event.py:30` | Accepted | Constant argv `rev-parse --show-toplevel`. | `# nosec B603` with the reason, this PR |
| B603 | `hooks/claude_event.py:87` | Accepted | Runs `sys.executable` on the repository's own `tooling/workflow.py`. The workflow id is one argv element read from the repository's state file, with no shell. | `# nosec B603` with the reason, this PR |
| B404 | `tooling/workflow.py:26` | Accepted | As for the hook. | `# nosec B404` with the reason, this PR |

## gitleaks

All nine are `generic-api-key`, and each was read in full before it was
silenced. None is printed here. Fingerprints are in `.gitleaksignore`.

A filesystem fingerprint is `path:rule:line`. `publish-content-manifest.yml`
regenerates the manifest weekly, so its three lines move. When they
reappear, check that the new lines are the same URL shape, then move the
fingerprints. A `.gitleaks.toml` allowlist keyed on the URL shape would
survive regeneration, but Qlty's gitleaks plugin did not read one when tested,
so it was not added.

## radarlint-iac

All 19 are S1135, "Complete the task associated to this TODO comment". Each
match is the file name `TODO.md` inside an explanatory comment, such as
`see TODO.md T-520` or `(TODO.md)`. None is a TODO marker.

radarlint has no inline suppression, and its only configuration is
`.qlty/qlty.toml`, where #588 added this rule. The rule key contains a colon,
so the match needs the plugin prefix; the bare `terraform:S1135` matches
nothing:

```toml
[[triage]]
match.plugins = ["radarlint-iac"]
match.rules = ["radarlint-iac:terraform:S1135"]
match.file_patterns = ["infra/**"]
set.ignored = true
```

Open work lives in GitHub issues (owner decision 2026-09-05). A real TODO in
`infra/` would name an issue number, not a TODO marker, so silencing S1135
there hides nothing the repository relies on.

## Owner decisions 2026-09-14

Nothing is left under *Needs owner decision*. The owner decided every group,
and [ADR 0031](../decisions/0031-security-scanner-owner-decisions.md) records each decision with its cost and what it gives up:

| Decision | Findings | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Key Vault purge protection on (one-way), superseding ADR 0021 | checkov CKV_AZURE_110, CKV_AZURE_42, trivy AZU-0016 | Fixed: `var.purge_protection_enabled = true` |
| Keep Microsoft-managed keys | checkov CKV2_AZURE_1 (x2), CKV_AZURE_100 | Accepted, inline skips |
| No private endpoints | checkov CKV2_AZURE_33, CKV2_AZURE_32 | Accepted, inline skips |
| Public network access off where possible | checkov CKV_AZURE_59, CKV_AZURE_101 | Accepted. Already *selected networks* with default Deny everywhere; `Disabled` would refuse the service-endpoint rules too |
| Keep the current accounts, no infrastructure encryption | trivy AZU-0061 (x2) | Accepted, inline ignores |
| Function host storage geo-redundancy | checkov CKV_AZURE_206, trivy AZU-0058 | Fixed: GRS |
| Storage resource logs | checkov CKV_AZURE_33 (x2), CKV2_AZURE_21, trivy AZU-0057 | Diagnostic settings for queues on both accounts and host blob writes and deletes. Host blob reads excluded by measurement |
| No Flex zone redundancy or always-ready instances | checkov CKV_AZURE_212, CKV_AZURE_225 | Accepted, inline skips |
