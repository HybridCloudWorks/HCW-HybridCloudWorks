# App-to-AddOn program

The program that splits each HCW product into an upstream **App** (the engine,
rules and UI, with an Azure appliance edition that runs on Container Apps under
a managed identity on a client's subscription) and a downstream **AddOn** (the
same image in a lab edition on the lab host, where a visitor uploads an Azure
Resource Graph export and gets an assessment held in memory for two hours), and
shows each AddOn on hybridcloudworks.com as a sandboxed pane at `/tools/<id>`.
The model is [ADR 0035](../../decisions/0035-addon-pane-model.md); the
contracts are the [AddOn integration standard](../../standards/addon-integration-standard.md).

## The three pairs

| Pair | App (upstream) | AddOn (downstream) | Site route | Row status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Migration](migration.md) | `HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_App` | `HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_Addon`, `migration.lab.hybridcloudworks.com` | `/tools/migration` (Tools menu: Migration Hub) | `available` |
| [Network assessment](network-assessment.md) | `HCW-NetworkEyes_App` | `HCW-NetworkEyes_AddOn`, `network-assessment.lab.hybridcloudworks.com` | `/tools/network-assessment` | `coming` since 2026-10-10 |
| [Cloud assessment](cloud-assessment.md) | `HCW-CloudAssessor_App` | `HCW-CloudAssessor_AddOn`, `cloud-assessment.lab.hybridcloudworks.com` | `/tools/cloud-assessment` | `coming` since 2026-10-10 |

Each pair's page records what the App keeps, what the AddOn is, its origin,
port, image and status on the site, and links the refactoring pull requests
the program opened in each repository.

## What lands where

The website is the integration layer and changes once, in one pull request,
from the written specification (owner decision 2026-10-09). Everything an
AddOn needs on the site is derived from one catalogue row:

| Side | What | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Site, data | One frozen row per AddOn: id, title, origin, pane and health paths, status, capabilities | `frontend/src/data/addons/catalogue.js` |
| Site, page | The generic pane page: status gate, sandbox and `allow` from the row's capabilities, the `hcw-addon` message filter, an allow-listed `navigate`, the 30-second watchdog, one unavailable sentence; a `coming` row renders an explainer | `frontend/src/pages/tools/AddOnPanePage.jsx`, one lazy wrapper per row in `pages/tools/` |
| Site, routing | One hand-declared route per row, the pre-render list and the Tools menu, all derived | `frontend/src/App.jsx`, `lib/routeFactory.ts`, `scripts/prerender-entry.jsx`, `components/shared/Header.jsx` |
| Site, policy | One exact origin per available row in `frame-src`; `connect-src` unchanged | `frontend/staticwebapp.config.json`, held by `lib/csp.test.js` |
| Function App | `GET /api/public/addons/{id}/status`: a closed registry of ids, a 5-second https-only read of the AddOn's `/api/health`, a one-minute cache per id, a six-field projection | `functions/src/lib/addons/`, `functions/addons-public-http.js` |
| Terraform | One plain app setting per available AddOn, `ADDON_<ID>_URL` (public, no vault) | `infra/functionapp.tf` |
| Admin | The Tool add-ons group: a service card tested through the status route, a Health probe, a directory row; the AddOn's vault key on Credentials | `components/admin/integrations/serviceRegistry.jsx`, `config/integrationsDirectory.js`, `pages/admin/health/probeGroups/enhanced.js`, `functions/src/lib/credentials/register.js` |
| Lab host | The generic `addons` Ansible role: one hardened container per `group_vars` row by digest on the loopback, a Caddy route per name with the site's sentence at 503 and a per-name direct-visit redirect, the vault key check, the end-of-run privilege checks | `lab-host/ansible/roles/addons/`, `group_vars/all.yml`, `roles/caddy/templates/Caddyfile.j2`, `roles/privilege_checks/` |
| Docs | The standard, this package, ADR 0035, the labs host record, the runbook's "Tool add-ons", the lab host README | `docs/standards/`, `docs/architecture/app-to-addon/`, `docs/decisions/`, `docs/architecture/labs-host.md`, `docs/runbooks/labs-host.md`, `lab-host/README.md` |

Nothing from an AddOn is installed into the site: no package, no secret, no
site credential. The only coupling is the image digest the host pins and the
address the status proxy reads.

## The pane, in one picture

```text

                                          │                                   │ ADDON_MIGRATION_URL (https only)

                                          ▼
GET https://migration.lab.hybridcloudworks.com/  (inside the pane only) ─────────────────────────────▶ Caddy: frame-ancestors = the site; 503 sentence if stopped

```

The site sends the pane nothing. A top-level visit to the AddOn's name is
redirected by Caddy to the AddOn's page on the site.

## Review items the program leaves open

- [REVIEW REQUIRED] ADR 0035 decision 8: AddOn containers beside Coder on the
  lab host, amending ADR 0032's "Compose is for Coder only" line.
- [REVIEW REQUIRED] ADR 0035 decision 9: `allow-downloads` on AddOn panes
  (`TODO.md`, Accepted risks).
- [REVIEW REQUIRED] One human-verification widget per AddOn, created by the
  owner; its secret seeded with `hcw-vault-set`
  ([runbook](../../runbooks/labs-host.md), "Tool add-ons").
- [VERIFY] The migration row's `image_digest` and `AMO_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` in
  `lab-host/ansible/group_vars/all.yml`, written in by the owner from the
  `v0.3.0` publish and the widget.
- The per-name direct-visit redirect's directive ordering was [VERIFY] and is
  answered: `caddy adapt` with the pinned Caddy runs in CI
  (`lab-host/ansible/roles/caddy/tests/caddy-adapt.test.sh`).
