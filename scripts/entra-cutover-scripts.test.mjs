/**
 * The production Entra scripts list no localhost, and nothing plain-http.
 *
 * PowerShell is otherwise untested in this repository, and these are the files
 * that rewrite the tenant. `functions/src/lib/auth/cors.js` already argues the
 * case at length:
 *
 *   LOCALHOST DOES NOT SURVIVE TO PRODUCTION. [...] `http://localhost:5173` in
 *   a production allowlist means any page running on a victim's machine — a
 *   malicious local dev server, a compromised `npm postinstall`, a rogue
 *   Electron app — can make cross-origin calls to production carrying the
 *   victim's token.
 *
 * It applies with more force to a redirect URI: a process listening on
 * 127.0.0.1 can complete an authorization-code redirect for the production
 * client id and receive the code. And unlike CORS, an app registration has no
 * `NODE_ENV` to gate it on — the only control is not listing it (#521).
 *
 * This is the "single plausible-looking line that no other test in this
 * repository would notice" that `msal-not-on-public-routes.test.js` exists to
 * catch, applied to the one place where getting it wrong changes the tenant.
