/**
 * Compare every alert rule `infra/` declares with the rules Azure holds, and
 * fail naming each one that is missing, disabled or not wired to its action
 * group (PLAT-4, #964). `.github/workflows/verify-alert-state.yml` runs this
 * weekly as `github_reader`.
 *
 * ## What it reads, and from where
 *
 * The expected inventory comes from the repository: `lib/alert-declarations.mjs`
 * reads every `.tf` file as one module and resolves each rule's Azure name,
 * resource group, subscription and action group. Nothing here lists a rule by
 * name, so a rule added to `infra/` is checked from the commit that adds it.
 *
 * The live inventory comes from Azure Resource Manager: one token from
 * `az account get-access-token`, then plain GETs, per resource group the
 * declarations name, of the three alert rule types, and a GET of each action
 * group. The subscription IDs are not in the configuration (the variables are
 * sensitive); each subscription's display name is, and `GET /subscriptions`
 * maps one to the other. A subscription the identity holds no role in is
 * absent from that list, which is reported as exactly that.
 *
 * ## What it decides
 *
 *   OK              present, enabled, wired to the declared action group, and
 *                   auto-resolution as declared.
 *   MISSING         declared, not live. When `assert-expected-plan.mjs`
 *                   declares the rule's create, the line says it is waiting
 *                   for an apply rather than gone, which is the opposite
 *                   repair.
 *   DISABLED        live with `enabled: false`.
 *   NOT WIRED       live, but its actions do not name the declared group.
 *   DRIFT           `autoMitigate` differs from the declaration (the one
 *                   attribute that decides whether a firing rule mails once
 *                   or every evaluation, ADR 0022 decision 6, and the reason
 *                   this workflow was first written), or the rule is live
 *                   while GATES records its gate as off.
 *   NOT AUTHORIZED  the identity may not read the group. Never collapsed
 *                   into MISSING: one means the alert fabric is gone, the
 *                   other that this check's own grant is.
 *   UNREADABLE      the same refusal, in a subscription UNREADABLE records
 *                   as not yet readable. Reported every run, and as a
 *                   workflow warning; its state is unknown. Not a failure.
 *   GATED OFF       a `count`-gated rule whose gate GATES records as off,
 *                   and absent. Not a failure.
 *
 * Every one of those but OK, UNREADABLE and GATED OFF fails the run. A live rule that no
 * declaration names is listed and does not fail it: it pages, so it is worth
 * seeing, and deleting it is a decision rather than a repair.
 *
 * The action group is read too. It must exist, be enabled and have at least
 * one receiver whose status is Enabled. Receiver NAMES and statuses are
 * printed; the address and number ARM returns beside them are not, because
 * this report is published on a public repository.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 *     node scripts/verify-alert-state.mjs                 # live check, needs az login
 *     node scripts/verify-alert-state.mjs --list          # the declared inventory, no Azure
 *     node scripts/verify-alert-state.mjs --summary FILE  # also append the report to FILE
 *
 * Exit 0 when every expected rule is OK, 1 when any is not, 2 when the check
 * could not run at all (no token, an unreadable configuration). Exit 2 is never
 * reported as health.
