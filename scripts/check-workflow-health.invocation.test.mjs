/**
 * How `monitor-deploy-drift.yml` invokes check-workflow-health.mjs is part of
 * the tool, not packaging around it.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. Every exit-2 path in the script writes with
 * `console.error` and nothing to stdout — the usage banner, the
 * paginated-listing refusal, the run-filter refusal. The job captured the
 * report with `report=$(node ...)`, which takes stdout alone. Measured
 * 2026-09-08: exit 2, **0 bytes captured**. So the job went red with a blank
 * step summary, in precisely the case an operator most needs to read why —
 * "the instrument could not look" rendered as "the instrument said nothing".
 * That is the same shape as verify-alert-state.yml's first run, which wrote
 * only the summary and could not be diagnosed without a browser. Caught in
 * review on the PR that split this script out of #426.
 *
 * The fix is `2>&1` on the invocation. It is four characters, it looks like
 * noise, and removing it restores a silent failure — which is why it is pinned
 * here rather than left to a comment. Same reasoning as
 * manifest-workflow.test.mjs, which pins `git add <one path>` against the
 * one-character slide to `git add -A`.
