/**
 * Open the manifest pull request and ask for auto-merge (T-726).
 *
 * The nightly refresh used to push straight to `main`. The ruleset refuses
 * that: `pull_request` is one of its rules and it lists no bypass actors
 * (verified 2026-08-31). So the push had been failing since 2026-08-25, and
 * nothing said so, because the published set did not move in that window and
 * the push path was never reached.
 *
 * Opening a pull request is how the refresh reaches `main` at all. The checks
 * run because it is opened with a GitHub App installation token rather than
 * `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub deliberately does not trigger workflows for events its
 * own token creates, which is exactly why the obvious version of this idea does
 * not work.
 *
 * An earlier version of this header said this removed a ruleset bypass. There
 * was no bypass to remove.
 *
 * AUTO-MERGE IS REQUESTED, NOT REQUIRED. `allow_auto_merge` was false on this
 * repository when this was written, so the request fails until an owner enables
 * it in Settings → General → Pull Requests. That failure leaves an open pull
 * request that a human can merge — a worse outcome than automatic, and a much
 * better one than a red nightly job and no manifest. It is reported as a notice
 * naming the setting, so the cause is legible without reading this file.
