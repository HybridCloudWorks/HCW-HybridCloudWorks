/**
 * migration-manifest.mjs
 *
 * The collection contract used to generate the website's Cosmos containers.
 *
 * The one-shot import tooling that created this file has been retired. The
 * manifest remains because Terraform and the container-spec generator still
 * need one source of truth for provisioned containers, partition keys, TTLs,
 * and historical data-disposition notes.
 *
 * The inventory was originally derived from the former Firebase rules and
 * application call sites in HybridCloudWorks/Site-Main. Those source files
 * are historical inputs and are no longer part of this repository.
 *
 * Re-baselined against Site-Main 088f458 (2026-08-18, v1.7.0) on 2026-08-20.
 * Site-Main's own inventory (`npm run inventory:collections` there) lists 68
 * collections; every one is either here or deliberately not. The two it has
 * that were missing here — `azure_architectures` and `azure_frameworks`,
 * written by `scripts/seed_azure_data.js` and matched by no rule — are now
 * `probe` entries so the preflight counts them instead of failing on them.
 * The current application contract is validated by the API and Terraform
 * checks in this repository. Keep this list aligned with those consumers.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Dispositions
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   migrate   — historical source-data disposition. The default.
 *   reseed    — seed data; re-created on the far side by a seeding script, so
 *               migrating it only imports drift. Container still provisioned.
 *   regenerate— cache; a scheduled job refills it. Do not migrate.
 *   transient — in-flight job/quota records with no value after cutover.
 *   probe     — historical declaration with no known application writer.
 *               Also: exists in Firestore with neither a rules match nor a
 *               writer at the baseline (legacy residue the 2026-08-21 preflight
 *               surfaced). Not provisioned; the owner decides from the counts.
 *               OWNER DECISION 2026-08-21 (runbook step 8): none of the fifteen
 *               probe entries migrates. The ten declared-but-unwritten ones are
 *               empty in Firestore; the five legacy ones hold seven documents
 *               between them and nothing reads them. They stay listed so the
 *               preflight gate passes for a reason rather than by omission.
 *               The preflight decides: 0 docs → drop, >0 docs → promote to
 *               `migrate` and work out where they came from before cutover.
 *
 * Provisioning and migrating are separate questions. A cache or a transient
 * job record does not get its *data* copied, but the runtime still writes to
 * it — `functions/src/functions/labs-http.js` reads and writes `lab_jobs` on
 * every request — so the container must exist. Everything except `probe` gets
 * a container; only `migrate` gets documents.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Partition keys
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every container is partitioned on `/id` except `content_versions` and
 * `admin_config`. The
 * evidence, from the Site-Main source rather than from the shape of the target:
 *
 *   1. The query load does not group by anything. All 18 Firestore composite
 *      indexes plus every `where()` in Site-Main show `content` filtered on
 *      `contentStatus`, `Live`, `type`, `slug`, `sourceUrl`, `normalizedUrl`,
 *      `source` and `fetchedAt`. Exactly one call site filters on a provider.
 *      A `/cloudProvider` key would have been 4–5 distinct values serving well
 *      under 1% of queries, fanning out on everything else.
 *   2. The previous "natural" keys were wrong on their own merits, not merely
 *      suboptimal:
 *        - `generated_content_images./contentId` — `cms-functions.js:3139` and
 *          `:5573` write `contentId: ''` on every document, which would have
 *          put the whole container in one logical partition keyed on the empty
 *          string, converging on the 20 GB logical-partition cap.
 *        - `lab_jobs./status` — a *mutable* field. A partition key value cannot
 *          be changed in place; Cosmos requires delete-and-recreate. Job
 *          documents transition queued → running → completed. This was a latent
 *          data-loss bug.
 *        - `lab_agents./agentId` — `vps-agent/index.js:33-34` writes
 *          `id: AGENT_ID, agentId: AGENT_ID`. Identical to `/id` by construction.
 *        - `certifications./issuer`, `audits./userId` — low cardinality, and
 *          `audits` is never queried at all.
 *   3. ~1,100 small documents across every container, well under 1 GB total.
 *      RU cost for a cross-partition query is driven by the number of *physical*
 *      partitions, not logical ones, and a container does not split until ~50 GB
 *      or sustained demand above 5,000 RU/s. Every container here is one
 *      physical partition, so "cross-partition" list queries are single-backend
 *      index scans. That stays true at 10x.
 *   4. `/id` makes the 20 GB logical-partition cap structurally unreachable, and
 *      `id` stays indexed even in the opt-in index policies below, because
 *      Cosmos always indexes `id` and `_ts` under `indexingMode: consistent`.
 *
 * `functions/src/lib/cosmos-client.js:60` also defaults the partition key to the
 * document id (`container.item(id, partitionKey || id)`), which agrees with the
 * above — but note this is a weak argument on its own: there are no `readDoc()`
 * callers at all, and the only affected line today is the `deleteDoc('content')`
 * at `functions/src/functions/cms-http.js:85`.
 *
 * EXCEPTION ONE — `content_versions` is partitioned on `/contentId`:
 *
 *   Every access to version history is scoped to one parent content document —
 *   `VersionHistoryDialog.jsx:33` reads `content/{blogId}/versions`, and
 *   `cms-functions.js:2832` does `recursiveDelete(ref.collection('versions'))`,
 *   a delete-all-versions-for-one-parent cascade. A new version document is
 *   written on every content save (`cms-functions.js:1822, 3810, 3903, 4607,
 *   4874`), so this is the one container with unbounded growth. `/contentId`
 *   makes both the read and the cascade single-partition; `/id` would fan out
 *   on both, forever.
 *
 *   There is a second reason specific to flattened subcollections: document ids
 *   are unique *per logical partition*, so under `/id` they must be globally
 *   unique across the container, and two version documents under different
 *   parents that share an id collide. Under `/contentId` they land in different
 *   logical partitions and coexist. The migrator detects such collisions at
 *   export time, but that is a permanent runtime constraint, not just a
 *   migration one.
 *
 *   Atomicity, settled 2026-08-18 (owner decision, option (a) of the choice
 *   recorded in Site-Main TODO §2): the post-and-its-history all-or-nothing
 *   guarantee the Firestore transaction gave does NOT carry over — a Cosmos
 *   TransactionalBatch cannot span containers, and versions deliberately
 *   live in their own container for the reasons above. The accepted contract
 *   is SEQUENTIAL writes with the content write FIRST (see
 *   functions/src/lib/cms/content-update.js's header for the full rationale):
 *   a crash between the content write and the version upsert loses that one
 *   snapshot, and the reverse order could record history for an edit that
 *   never happened. All three writers (content-update.js,
 *   content-workflow.js, publish.js) follow this ordering today; keep any
 *   future version writer on it. Co-locating versions inside `content` to
 *   buy the batch back was considered and declined.
 *
 * EXCEPTION TWO — `admin_config` is partitioned on `/configScope`, a
 * CONSTANT (every document carries `configScope: 'admin_config'`):
 *
 *   Decided 2026-08-17 by the owner, recorded in Site-Main TODO §2: the
 *   ContentForge save writes `forge_profile` and `forge_prompts` as one
 *   all-or-nothing Firestore transaction, and a Cosmos TransactionalBatch
 *   only spans one container AND one logical partition. Under `/id` those
 *   two documents land in different partitions and the save loses its
 *   atomicity at the port. A constant key puts every `admin_config` document
 *   in one logical partition, so the forge save ports to a batch unchanged.
 *
 *   The knock-on, accepted in the same decision: everything in
 *   `admin_config` shares that single logical partition. That is fine at
 *   this container's size and nature — a handful of config documents
 *   (forge_profile, forge_prompts, forge_stats), not content — and nowhere
 *   near the 20 GB logical-partition cap.
 *
 * A partition key path is immutable once the container exists. Changing one
 * later means recreating the container and re-importing, so this needs sign-off
 * before the first Terraform apply. The full write-up — the Site-Main review
 * findings, the decision log and the runbook — lives on the
 * `Phase-4-Data-Migration` Wiki page, per the repository's documentation policy.

 * reads after the window closes. Two hours of TTL covers the window plus clock
 * skew, and lets the limiter drop its window arithmetic entirely — an expired
 * document simply is not there.
 *
 * A TTL requires `indexingMode: consistent`, which every container here uses.
 * Unlike a partition key, `default_ttl` IS mutable after creation, so these are
 * safe to tune later. They are set now because the containers do not exist yet

    // Nothing in the Azure runtime can resolve a Firebase uid: the role guard
    // looks up `admins/{oid}` using the Entra object id from the token
    // (functions/src/lib/auth/require-role.js). Migrating these documents
    // faithfully therefore produces a container the API cannot read — every
    // admin request 403s with "no admin record", which reads as a broken
    // deployment rather than a data problem.
    //
    // Straight migration is NOT sufficient here, and this is the one place in
    // the manifest where fidelity is the wrong goal.
    //
    // Required before cutover:
    //   1. Produce a uid -> oid mapping. The only reliable join key is the
    //      verified email: Firebase Auth's user export carries uid + email +
    //      emailVerified; Entra carries oid + mail/userPrincipalName.
    //   2. Have a human review it. This collection is the authorisation root
    //      and it is small (a handful of admins), so a reviewed, committed
    //      mapping is proportionate — do NOT trust-on-first-use by email, which
    //      would let anyone who controls a matching mailbox claim an admin row.
    //   3. Re-key on import, keeping the Firebase uid on the document as
    //      `firebaseUid` for the audit trail.
