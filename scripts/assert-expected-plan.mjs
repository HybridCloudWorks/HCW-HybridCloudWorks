/**
 * Assert that a Terraform plan contains ONLY the known permanent diff (T-724).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `infra/main.tf` carries a read-then-strip pair that works around
 * hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm#29149, and its cost is that a clean plan
 * no longer exists. Every plan reports:
 *
 *     ~ "RUNTIME_CONFIG_WRITER" = "azapi-strip" -> "azurerm"
 *     Plan: 3 to add, 1 to change, 3 to destroy
 *
 * and a comment in `main.tf` says that a plan reporting exactly that "and
 * nothing else means NO DRIFT".
 *
 * ADR 0018's convergence proof was an EMPTY plan. Operators are now trained to
 * approve a specific non-empty shape by pattern-matching it, and the thing
 * pattern-matching misses is real drift sitting inside or beside the expected
 * trio — three destroys look like three destroys. T-708 is what makes the
 * consequence data loss rather than inconvenience: `prevent_destroy` now covers
 * the Cosmos containers, but a regenerated spec still produces a
 * destroy-and-create plan, and its only gate is a human reading carefully.
 *
 * So the assertion moves out of a comment and into a program.
 *
 * ## Every attribute, not only app_settings (#719)
 *
 * Until #719 an update to the Function App was compared on `app_settings`
 * alone. #718 moved `runtime_version` from "22" to "24" and this reported the
 * plan as expected without reading that attribute, and a stray change to
 * `instance_memory_in_mb`, `https_only`, `virtual_network_subnet_id` or the
 * storage settings would have passed the same way.
 *
 * Every update in the plan is now compared `before` against `after`, leaf by
 * leaf, and each difference is named by its path:
 *
 *     runtime_version
 *     site_config[0].cors[0].allowed_origins[2]
 *     app_settings.RUNTIME_CONFIG_WRITER
 *     app_settings["AzureWebJobs.syncContent.Disabled"]
 *
 * On an update, two kinds of difference are tolerated and nothing else. The
 * first is the `EXPECTED.updated` app setting, whatever its values, which is
 * the T-724 allow-list unchanged. The second is a change declared in
 * `DECLARED` below, with exactly the declared values. Every other difference
 * is UNEXPECTED, printed as `address: update path: before -> after`.
 *
 * THE REPORT IS PUBLIC, AND THE PLAN IS NOT. This repository is public, and
 * `tfc-plan-check.yml` writes the verdict to a job summary anyone can read.
 * `terraform show -json` carries sensitive values in plaintext in `before`,
 * `after` and `variables`, flagged only by `before_sensitive`,
 * `after_sensitive` and the variable's `sensitive` (checked against Terraform
 * 1.15.8 on 2026-09-27). So values are printed by the rules in
 * `lib/plan-report.mjs`, not as Terraform's own renderer prints them behind
 * workspace access. In short: sensitive values print as `(sensitive)`, unknown
 * ones as `(known after apply)`, `app_settings` values as `(set)`, any string
 * the plan marks sensitive anywhere is replaced wherever else it appears, and
 * GUIDs and email addresses are masked. `runtime_version: "22" -> "24"` still
 * reads in full. Before #719 this printed only app-setting names.
 *
 * An update missing any of those markers is not guessed at: the check exits
 * 2. So does a change with no action list. An action it does not recognise,
 * such as `["forget"]`, and an import or a move, are UNEXPECTED even when the
 * action is a no-op.
 *
 * ## Declaring an intended change
 *
 * The pull request that makes a change declares it by adding an entry to
 * `DECLARED`, in this file, in the same diff:
 *
 *     {
 *       address: 'azurerm_function_app_flex_consumption.hcw',
 *       path: 'runtime_version',
 *       before: '22',
 *       after: '24',
 *       reason: '#718: Node.js 24 on Flex Consumption',
 *     }
 *
 * A new or removed resource is declared by its action instead, since there
 * are no values to compare: `{ address, action: 'create', reason }` (or
 * `'delete'`), with the address exact, for_each key included (#816).
 *
 * `path` is written as this script prints it. The entry matches that address,
 * that path and exactly those two values, so a reviewer reads the expectation
 * beside the change it permits. Once the change has applied, the entry matches
 * nothing, and a later drift of the same attribute is caught again rather than
 * waved through by a stale line. A declaration the plan does not contain is
 * printed as a NOTE, not a failure. Usually its change has applied, and the
 * note is the prompt to delete the entry.
 *
 * A sensitive or unknown difference cannot be declared. Matching one would
 * mean writing its value here, so such an entry never matches, and the plan
 * waits for a person to read it.
 *
 * `tfc-plan-check.yml` reads the declarations on the ref it was dispatched
 * from (normally `main`), not those at the commit the run was planned for.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 *     terraform show -json tfplan > plan.json
 *     node scripts/assert-expected-plan.mjs plan.json
 *
 * Exit 0 when the change set is exactly the expected diff (or empty). Exit 1
 * with the unexpected changes named, and exit 2 on a malformed plan — those are
 * distinguished because "the plan is not what I think it is" and "I could not
 * read the plan" call for different responses, and collapsing them is how a
 * broken checker gets read as a clean estate.
 *
 * ## Where it runs
 *
 * `.github/workflows/tfc-plan-check.yml` runs this, through
 * `check-tfc-plan.mjs`, against a plan HCP Terraform is holding for
 * confirmation. It is dispatched rather than triggered, and that workflow's
 * header says why. Run by hand against a saved plan, it is the same check.
 * (This section said "not wired into CI" until #719; `tfc-plan-check.yml`
 * had wired it since #284.)
 *
 * ## When #29149 closes
 *
 * Delete this file with the azapi pair. `EXPECTED` going empty is the signal
 * that the workaround is gone: at that point the correct assertion is simply
 * "the plan is empty", which this already handles.
