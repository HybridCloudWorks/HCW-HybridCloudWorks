// Report app settings whose Key Vault reference is NOT resolving (T-720).
//
// WHY THIS IS A WORKFLOW AND NOT THE ALERT RULE THE TRACKER ASKED FOR.
//
// TODO.md carried "a scheduled-query alert on unresolvedSecrets ... needs an
// apply" for weeks. There was nothing to apply, and there could not be: the
// count exists only as a field in the /api/health RESPONSE BODY. Nothing writes
// it to Log Analytics, so a scheduled-query rule would run against a table that
// never receives it and return zero rows forever — an alert that reads as
// healthy precisely because it can never fire.
//
// The obvious second design fails too. A workflow cannot simply curl
// /api/health: through Cloudflare a GitHub-hosted runner gets a Bot Fight Mode
// 403, and direct to origin it gets the origin lock's 403, because the site
// denies every address outside Cloudflare's ranges. validate-deployed.yml
// documents that it cannot pass from a runner for exactly this reason.
//
// So this reads the CONDITION through ARM instead, which is the same argument
// monitor-functions-registered.yml already makes and wins on the same axes: it
// survives the Log Analytics daily cap that silences every rule in
// observability.tf, it does not traverse Cloudflare, it needs no metric that
// does not exist, and it names WHICH setting is broken rather than a count.
//
// NAMES, NEVER VALUES. A reference that fails to resolve is a credential
// problem, and the standing rule in this repository is that a missing
// credential is recorded by name, owner and location — never by value. This
// prints setting names and statuses. It deliberately does not print the vault
// URI, which carries the vault name, secret name and version.

 * as many words is "the fallback and is expected to stay unresolved". Azure AI
 * Speech is a written, tested second path for the day the preview Gemini TTS
 * models are retired; using it means creating a Cognitive Services resource,
 * which is a spend decision nobody has made. An unseeded reference arrives as
 * the literal @Microsoft.KeyVault(...) string, readSetting() treats that as no
 * key at all, and the provider is simply not offered.
 *
 * A monitor that is red every six hours for a condition its own repository
 * documents as intended is not a monitor. It is a thing people mute, and then
 * the real finding arrives into a channel nobody reads. That failure mode is
 * named in this workflow's own header, which makes shipping it here worse than
 * careless.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT A MUTE. An entry here is reported every run, just not as a
 * failure — and if one ever starts resolving, that is reported too, because it
 * means this list and the comment in functionapp.tf have gone stale.
