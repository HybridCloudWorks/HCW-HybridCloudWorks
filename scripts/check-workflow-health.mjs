/**
 * Which workflows in this repository have stopped being able to succeed?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `validate-deployed.yml` was dispatched twice on 2026-08-18,
 * failed both times, and then sat in `.github/workflows/` for three weeks. Its
 * own header explained why it could not pass from a GitHub-hosted runner
 * (Cloudflare answers a datacenter IP with a 403, so its single assertion
 * `test "$code" = "200"` can never hold), so the knowledge was not missing —
 * nothing was reading it. Nothing in the repository looked at run history and
 * said "this one has never worked". This does.
 *
 * IT MEASURES, IT DOES NOT ASSERT. There is no list of workflows in this file
 * to keep in step with the directory, and no per-workflow expectation to
 * update. The verdict comes from run history — what actually happened — read
 * per workflow from `/actions/workflows/{id}/runs`, and deliberately NOT from
 * `/actions/runs?workflow_id=…`, which accepts the filter and ignores it. That
 * trap is recorded in full at the call site, and naming the wrong endpoint here
 * would undercut it. Measuring rather than asserting is what means a workflow
 * added tomorrow is covered tomorrow and one deleted today stops being checked
 * today; a hand-maintained list would have needed someone to notice the thing
 * this file exists to notice.
 *
 * THE THREE VERDICTS ARE KEPT APART, because collapsing them is the mistake
 * this repository keeps paying for (T-514; `05-verify-timer.ps1` 2026-08-30;
 * the exit-code split in `tfc-plan-check.yml`):
 *
 *   healthy    a success in the sampled window.
 *   unproven   this tool is making no claim, reached three ways: nothing
 *              finished to read (never ran, or still running); everything
 *              that finished stopped short of a verdict (cancelled, neutral,
 *              action_required, skipped, stale); or a real failure that is
 *              still inside the staleness window, which is somebody mid-debug
 *              rather than an abandonment. NOT a pass and NOT a fail in any
 *              of the three. A workflow dispatched once and cancelled says
 *              nothing about whether it works; one that failed an hour ago
 *              says nothing about whether anybody is coming back. Widened
 *              from "the instrument had nothing to measure" in review, which
 *              described the first two ways in and not the third.
 *   broken     nothing in the sample succeeded, at least one run failed, AND
 *              the newest run of any kind is older than the staleness
 *              threshold. All three are required. A workflow that failed twice
 *              in the last hour is somebody mid-debug and is not this tool's
 *              business; a workflow that has never succeeded and last ran
 *              three weeks ago is.
 *
 * WHY `broken` IS "NOTHING SUCCEEDED" AND NOT "EVERY RUN FAILED". Those differ
 * only for a mixed sample — say one failure and one cancellation, both a month
 * old — and there the second reading is the wrong one twice over. It is false
 * on its face: that workflow failed, was never made to work, and has been
 * left. And the bucket it would fall into says so out loud, because the
 * `unproven` line reads "N run(s), none of which reached a verdict" about a
 * run that reached a verdict of failure. It would also make a single stray
 * cancellation enough to hide the case this file was written for:
 * `validate-deployed.yml`'s real history is two failures, and a third run
 * cancelled by whoever gave up on it would have moved it out of the finding
 * and into a collapsed block. A detector that misses is worse than one that
 * over-reports, because nobody audits the quiet answer. What keeps the
 * over-reporting honest is that the verdict states its own arithmetic — "N of
 * M sampled run(s) failed, none succeeded" — so a mixed sample reports itself
 * as mixed and a reader can disagree with it from the line alone. Raised in
 * review on PR #426.
 *
 * WHY STALENESS IS PART OF THE FAILURE CONDITION rather than a separate
 * finding. The subject is "nobody is coming back to this", and freshness is
 * the only available evidence for it. Failing on a fresh red would page on
 * every ordinary broken-then-fixed afternoon, and a detector that fires on
 * ordinary work stops being read — which is the failure mode that let the
 * three weeks happen in the first place.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT SEE. A workflow that succeeds while asserting nothing. A
 * workflow whose jobs are individually red inside a green run. Neither is
 * visible from run conclusions, and pretending otherwise would make this the
 * kind of green check that means nothing.
 *
 * Run it:
 *
 *   GITHUB_TOKEN=... GITHUB_REPOSITORY=owner/repo node scripts/check-workflow-health.mjs
 *
 * Exit 0 when nothing is broken, 1 when something is, 2 when the run history
 * could not be read at all — "I could not look" and "I looked and it is fine"
 * are opposite conclusions and a single exit code would merge them.
