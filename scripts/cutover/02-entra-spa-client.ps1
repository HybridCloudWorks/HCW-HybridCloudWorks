.SYNOPSIS
    Entra, part 2 of 2 — the SPA registration users sign in with.

.DESCRIPTION
    This is the CLIENT half. It creates (or updates) a registration that is a
    public client and nothing else: SPA redirect URIs, and delegated permission
    to the API's `access_as_admin` scope. It exposes no API, defines no app
    roles, and holds no credentials.

    ===========================================================================
    WHY THERE ARE TWO (#522)
    ===========================================================================
    Until 2026-09-12 one registration did both jobs: the former
    01-entra-spa.ps1 added an SPA platform to the API's own registration. Its
    reasoning is worth keeping, because it was sound and somebody will re-derive
    it otherwise:

        ~~It uses a SPA platform on the EXISTING registration rather than a
        second registration — TODO.md allows either, and one registration means
        the SPA requests a scope on its own app, which consents automatically
        and removes the single highest-risk mismatch in the system (a SPA client
        id and an API audience that disagree).~~

    Struck through, for two reasons.

    First, the mismatch it was avoiding is now caught before it ships:
    `assertDeployConfig` in frontend/vite.config.js refuses a deploy build whose
    Entra ids are not GUIDs (#516), so a wrong client id fails the build rather
    than reaching production.

    Second, three other places in this repository — ADR 0006,
    `functions/src/lib/auth/verify-token.js` DECISION 3, and
    `infra/variables.tf` — all specified two registrations. The tenant had
    quietly diverged from an accepted decision, and a codebase that describes a
    tenant it does not have is worse than either choice made deliberately.

    Microsoft's own reason is permission inheritance: "if the web API has a
    higher set of permissions, then the client app doesn't inherit them". One
    registration means one service principal, so any credential or Graph
    permission ever added for the API is simultaneously available to a
    browser-delivered public client.

    ===========================================================================
    WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE
    ===========================================================================
    `ENTRA_API_AUDIENCE` and `VITE_ENTRA_API_SCOPE`. The split changes the
    CLIENT, not the resource, so `aud` stays the API's client id. Exactly one
    value changes: the `VITE_ENTRA_CLIENT_ID` repository variable, which this
    script prints at the end. App-role assignments also stay put — they live on
    the API's service principal (see 01-entra-api.ps1).

.PARAMETER Prune
    Replace the SPA redirect URIs with exactly the list below, removing any
    others. Without it the list is unioned, which is the safer default for an
    unattended run but will not remove anything.

.PARAMETER WhatIf
    Print what would change and exit without writing.

.EXAMPLE
    ./02-entra-spa-client.ps1 -WhatIf
    ./02-entra-spa-client.ps1
    ./02-entra-spa-client.ps1 -Prune

.NOTES
    Requires: az CLI, signed in (`az login`) as Application Administrator,
    Cloud Application Administrator, or Global Administrator.

    LOCALHOST IS NOT HERE, AND MUST NOT BE ADDED. See 03-entra-dev-client.ps1.
