.SYNOPSIS
    Cutover step 3d — point the Telegram bot at Azure (TODO.md T-512).

.DESCRIPTION
    Migration_Plan §6 step 6. The URL and its secret token are registered with
    TELEGRAM, not in code, so deploying the receiver changes nothing on its own
    — the bot keeps POSTing at the Cloud Functions URL until `setWebhook` is
    re-run. That is the half of this step that gets forgotten, and nothing
    breaks until GCP is decommissioned, at which point the bot goes quiet with
    no error anywhere in Azure.

    The receiver now exists here: POST /api/telegram/webhook, implemented in
    functions/src/functions/telegram-http.js. It is anonymous because Telegram
    cannot send a bearer token, and guarded instead by:

      1. X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token, which Telegram echoes back from
         whatever is registered below, compared in constant time against
         sha256(TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN).
      2. The sending chat id, which must equal TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID.

    The secret is DERIVED from the bot token rather than stored separately —
    one secret to rotate, and no way for the two to drift apart. This script
    computes it the same way the running code does, so there is nothing to keep
    in sync by hand.

.PARAMETER Mode
    Set     - register the Azure webhook URL (default)
    Show    - print current webhook info from Telegram, change nothing
    Delete  - unregister entirely (the "retire the bot" option)

.PARAMETER BotToken
    The bot token. Omitted, the script reads it from Key Vault, which needs a
    firewall window — pass it directly if you have it to hand.

.EXAMPLE
    ./04-telegram-webhook.ps1 -Mode Show
    ./04-telegram-webhook.ps1
    ./04-telegram-webhook.ps1 -Mode Delete

.NOTES
    Run this AFTER the receiver is deployed. Registering a webhook that 404s
    makes Telegram retry and back off, and the bot looks broken for a while
    after you fix it.

    Requires: PowerShell 7. Key Vault access only when -BotToken is omitted.
