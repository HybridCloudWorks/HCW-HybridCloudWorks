.SYNOPSIS
    Entra, part 1 of 2 — the API registration, and who may reach it.

.DESCRIPTION
    This is the RESOURCE half: the app registration the API validates tokens
    against, and the `Admin` app-role assignment that is guard gate 1. The
    CLIENT half — the SPA that signs users in — is 02-entra-spa-client.ps1.

    Split out of the former 01-entra-spa.ps1 by #522. That script did both jobs
    against one registration; see the "WHY THERE ARE TWO" note in
    02-entra-spa-client.ps1 for what changed and why.

    What this script assumes already exists, and asserts rather than creates:

        app registration  HCWSite API  ac696e96-e203-47be-ade8-c35ece8a6c4a
        identifier URI    api://ac696e96-e203-47be-ade8-c35ece8a6c4a
        exposed scope     access_as_admin
        app roles         Admin, LabAgent (both enabled)
        token version     requestedAccessTokenVersion = 2

    If any is missing the tenant is not in the state this was written against,
    and guessing at the difference is worse than stopping.

    THE APP ROLE IS ASSIGNED HERE, NOT ON THE SPA. Roles are defined and
    assigned on the registration of the API being called, and the `roles` claim
    rides in the access token regardless of which client asked for it. Splitting
    the client out (#522) therefore does NOT require re-granting anything.

.PARAMETER AdminUpn
    User principal name to grant the Admin app role. Defaults to the signed-in
    user. This is guard gate 1; gate 2 is the `admins/{oid}` registry, seeded
    separately with CMS_BOOTSTRAP_ALLOWED_UIDS / _EMAILS.

.PARAMETER WhatIf
    Print what would change and exit without writing.

.EXAMPLE
    ./01-entra-api.ps1 -WhatIf
    ./01-entra-api.ps1
    ./01-entra-api.ps1 -AdminUpn someone@hybridcloudworks.com

.NOTES
    Requires: az CLI, signed in (`az login`) as someone who can update app
    registrations and assign app roles — Application Administrator, Cloud
    Application Administrator, or Global Administrator.
