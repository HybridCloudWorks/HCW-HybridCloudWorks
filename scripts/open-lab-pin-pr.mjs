/**
 * open-lab-pin-pr.mjs — one pull request per lab pin set, kept current
 * (estate review 2026-10-06, LAB-3; #949).
 *
 * `lab-pins-upstream.mjs --bump <set>` makes a set's edits and writes the
 * evidence; this commits them to the set's own branch and keeps exactly one
 * open pull request for that branch:
 *
 *   no branch, or no open pull request   push the branch, open the pull request
 *   open, branch holds only bot commits  force-push the new reading (with a
 *                                        lease on the sha read a moment ago) and
 *                                        rewrite the body, unless the tree is
 *                                        already the same, when only the body moves
 *   open, someone else wrote or amended  push nothing; comment the new reading
 *                                        instead, so a person's fix is never lost
 *
 * It stages the set's paths by name and refuses to run when anything outside
 * them has changed: the branch the App pushes is the one thing its write
 * permission reaches. Ready for review, never a draft (.claude/CLAUDE.md), and
 * no auto-merge: each bump is read by a person.
 *
 * The token is a GitHub App installation token (MANIFEST_APP_*), not
 * GITHUB_TOKEN: GitHub does not run workflows for events its own token
 * creates, so a pull request opened with it would never get its required
 * checks (publish-content-manifest.yml has the history).
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/open-lab-pin-pr.mjs --paths <set>
 *        node scripts/open-lab-pin-pr.mjs --set <set> --evidence <file> [--notes <file>]
 *   env: GH_TOKEN (the App token), GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GITHUB_SERVER_URL, GITHUB_RUN_ID
