/**
 * How long production has been behind `main`, per deployed service.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * `deploy-functions.yml` and `deploy-azure-frontend.yml` are both
 * workflow_dispatch only, by a recorded decision: enabling a workflow and
 * enabling auto-deploy-on-merge are separate choices, and only the first was
 * made. Merging therefore deploys nothing, and NOTHING SAID SO.
 *
 * That single gap produced both of 2026-08-31's incidents, hours apart and both
 * found by accident:
 *
 *   - The manifest route merged at 2026-08-30 02:45 UTC against a Function App
 *     last deployed at 01:21. `publish-content-manifest.yml` then failed with a
 *     404 for two nights, and the failure message blamed the app.
 *   - The frontend was 35 commits behind, discovered only because someone
 *     deployed it for an unrelated reason.
 *
 * ## WHY AGE AND NOT COMMIT COUNT
 *
 * The obvious check is "how many commits behind". It cannot separate these two:
 * the 404 was **one** commit behind, the frontend **thirty-five**. Any threshold
 * that catches the first fires on every ordinary merge, and any threshold that
 * tolerates ordinary merges misses the outage.
 *
 * What the two share is TIME. Both sat undeployed for days. Drift measured in
 * hours tolerates the normal merge-then-deploy gap — which is the whole point of
 * dispatch-only releases — and still catches a change that was merged and
 * forgotten. So this reports the age of the OLDEST undeployed commit touching a
 * service's own paths, and fails past a threshold.
 *
 * ## Paths, not commits
 *
 * A service is only "behind" when something it ships has changed. Thirty commits
 * touching only `wiki/` leave the Function App exactly as correct as it was.
 * Each service therefore declares the paths it deploys, and drift is measured
 * over commits touching those.
 *
 * ## On running this from a schedule GitHub delivers unreliably
 *
 * `monitor-functions-registered.yml` is documented as hourly and is delivered
 * about 22% of the time, a median 36 minutes late, with a 12.7-hour worst-case
 * gap (measured 2026-08-31). That is a real problem for an outage detector and
 * is NOT one here: this watches a condition measured in days, against a
 * threshold measured in hours. A check that lands every 4.6 hours on average is
 * ample for a 24-hour threshold, and saying so is better than pretending the
 * cron is honoured.
