/**
 * The Terraform run identity may ASSIGN roles. It may not INVENT them.
 *
 * ## The failure this catches
 *
 * `azurerm_role_definition` needs `Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write`.
 * The HCP Terraform workspace identity is Contributor + Role Based Access
 * Control Administrator, and neither built-in role carries it — verified
 * against Microsoft's published definitions, not from memory:
 *
 *   - Contributor's notActions include `Microsoft.Authorization/*\/Write`.
 *   - RBAC Administrator's actions are roleAssignments/write,
 *     roleAssignments/delete, `*\/read` and Microsoft.Support/*. `*\/read`
 *     covers roleDefinitions/READ and stops there.
 *
 * So a `resource "azurerm_role_definition"` block does not fail review, does
 * not fail `terraform validate`, does not fail `plan` — it fails at APPLY, on
 * the owner's confirmation, with an authorization error naming
 * Microsoft.Authorization rather than the feature being deployed. infra/oidc.tf
 * records that happening on 2026-08-21; infra/keyvault.tf reintroduced it on
 * 2026-08-29 in the two roles the API Keys page depends on, where it would have
 * broken the very apply that turns the page on. Twice is a pattern, and a
 * pattern that only shows up at apply time is what a guard is for.
 *
 * ## The shape that works instead
 *
 * The owner creates the definition once from reviewed JSON in `infra/roles/`,
 * and Terraform consumes it by name:
 *
 *   az role definition create --role-definition @infra/roles/<name>.json
 *
 *   data "azurerm_role_definition" "x" { name = "..." scope = ... }
 *   resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "y" { role_definition_id = data...id }
 *
 * That is what this asserts: no `resource` form anywhere in the module, and
 * every `data` form backed by a JSON file whose `Name` matches, so the lookup
 * cannot silently name a role nobody ever created. A missing definition would
 * otherwise surface as "role definition not found" at apply — the same class of
 * late failure, one step further along.
