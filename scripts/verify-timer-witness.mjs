/**
 * Read a timer's DURABLE SIDE EFFECT through the public API, and say whether it
 * is newer than a moment you name. No az, no workspace, no telemetry plane.
 *
 * Why this exists — 2026-09-03. Cutover-Runbook step 5's fourth gate reads
 * `Function.<name>` traces in AppTraces to prove a timer fired. #321 dropped
 * host.json's `Function` category to Warning to get AppTraces volume off the
 * daily cap, and those traces are Information-level: after the 17:59Z deploy
 * the host stopped writing them, and `05-verify-timer.ps1` stopped being able
 * to see any invocation at all. The #321 record believed it had preserved the
 * gate by keeping `Host.Results` — but that feeds AppRequests, which the verify
 * script's own header says has been empty for the app's whole life (T-514).
 * The cut kept the table the gate does not read and removed the one it does.
 *
 * The runbook already names the way out: "pair the telemetry with a durable
 * side effect the timer necessarily creates ... if telemetry and the witness
 * disagree, believe the witness." This reads the witness. Owner decision
 * 2026-09-03: keep the cut, make the side effect the primary evidence.
 *
 * Only timers whose side effect is PUBLICLY readable are covered, and the
 * table says which are not. A timer with no public witness is reported as
 * exactly that — exit 2, not a pass and not a fail — because "cannot evaluate"
 * and "evaluated and failed" are different findings, and this repository has
 * paid for conflating them before (check-todo-changelog-movement.mjs).
 *
 *   node scripts/verify-timer-witness.mjs --timer syncRssFeeds --since 2026-09-03T05:00:00Z
 *
 * `--since` is the moment after which you expect a fire — the apply time, or
 * the last scheduled tick. No cron parser here on purpose: the schedule is
 * something the operator already knows, and a parser is a second thing to be
 * wrong about.
