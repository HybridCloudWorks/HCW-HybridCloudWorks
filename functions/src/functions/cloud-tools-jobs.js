/**
 * cloud-tools-jobs.js — the pricing cache's two registrations (#613): the
 * daily timer that enqueues a refresh onto the platform jobs queue, and the
 * job type the worker runs it as.
 *
 * The timer ENQUEUES rather than refreshes. A run is 24 live lookups across
 * three regions, fetched one service at a time so AWS and Azure do not
 * throttle it; that is minutes of work, which belongs under the job worker's
 * budget and in a job document an operator can read, not inside a timer
 * whose only record is a duration. Same shape as cosmosExportScheduler.
 *
 * Gated like every timer: the master `FEATURE_FLAG_SCHEDULERS` must not be
 * "false" AND `FEATURE_FLAG_REFRESH_TOOL_SERVICE_CACHE` must be "true" — the
 * shared gate in lib/timers/flag-gate.js, so the first skip after a restart
 * is a Warning that reaches Log Analytics. The flag is in
 * `local.timer_catalogue` (infra/functionapp.tf) and arms through
 * `enabled_timers` like the rest; the app-clock is UTC (#416), so 02:00 is
 * 02:00 UTC, an hour before the Cosmos export.
 *
 * Provider credentials: Azure needs none, AWS reads AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and
 * AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, GCP reads GCP_BILLING_API_KEY — all Key Vault
 * references (secret-catalog.js, section `cloud`). Until they are seeded a
 * run yields Azure live and the other two on baseline or absent, which is a
 * complete document, not a failed job: each provider is isolated inside
 * `fetchLivePricing`, and this file keeps it that way by never reading a
 * credential itself.
