/**
 * The app clock is UTC, and no schedule silently depends on it not being.
 *
 * Owner decision 2026-09-07 (#416): all times in this app are UTC.
 *
 * ## The failure this catches
 *
 * An NCRONTAB hour is not a time until something says which clock it is read
 * against, and that something is an app setting in a different repository
 * directory from the expression. For most of this app's life it was
 * `WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE = America/Chicago` (infra/functionapp.tf), so `0 0 3 * * *`
 * in cosmos-export.js meant 08:00 UTC in summer and 09:00 in winter — while six
 * places in the Terraform and the ADR said "03:00 UTC", including the
 * description of `alert-cosmos-export-daily`, which is the sentence that
 * arrives in the alert mail. An operator reading it at 05:00 UTC would have
 * gone looking for a run that was not due for another three hours. That is
 * issue #416, and nothing in the test suite could see it: the expression was
 * valid, the setting was valid, and only their combination was wrong.
 *
 * Re-adding the setting — or `TZ`, which does the same job — would silently
 * move **fifteen** of the nineteen registered timers and make the same six
 * sentences wrong again. There is no plan diff that reads as "every timer
 * moved five hours"; it reads as one app setting.
 *
 * Fifteen is the number this file enforces, and it is worth splitting because
 * the two halves matter differently to an operator:
 *
 *   - **Nine change the instant they run.** The fixed-hour and fixed-day
 *     schedules — a 07:00 digest becomes a 07:00 UTC digest, five hours
 *     earlier in wall-clock terms. This is the half that shows up as "the
 *     report arrived in the middle of the night".
 *   - **Six change phase but not cadence.** The hour-interval forms — every
 *     two, four, six and twelve hours — still fire that often; WHICH hours
 *     shifts by minus five, modulo the interval. Nothing depends on those
 *     landing on particular hours, which is why they are the quieter half —
 *     but they ARE clock-dependent, and a guard that ignored them would pass
 *     while the estate moved underneath it.
 *
 * The remaining four are minute-only, every five or fifteen minutes, and
 * cannot move in any zone. The classifier below decides which bucket each one
 * is in from its hour field rather than from a list, so this comment describes
 * the count and does not produce it.
 *
 * (Interval expressions are spelled out in words here rather than written
 * literally: an asterisk-slash sequence inside a block comment closes it, and
 * doing that in this file breaks the parser rather than the prose.)
 *
 * ## What is asserted, and what is deliberately not
 *
 *   1. **The app clock is UTC.** `infra/*.tf` sets neither `WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE`
 *      nor `TZ`, so NCRONTAB gets the platform default, which Microsoft
 *      documents as UTC. Absence is the assertion because absence is the
 *      configuration: setting `WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE = "UTC"` would be the same
 *      clock, but it is also documented as unsupported on Flex Consumption
 *      ("can create SSL-related issues and cause metrics to stop working"),
 *      so the setting existing at all is the thing worth failing on.
 *
 *   2. **Every clock-dependent schedule is written down in UTC.** A schedule
 *      whose firing instants change when the clock changes is listed in
 *      `CLOCK_DEPENDENT` below with the UTC time it is meant to mean. The
 *      classification is COMPUTED from the expression, not typed out: adding a
 *      timer on a fixed hour, or changing one, fails here until someone writes
 *      the UTC intent next to it. A schedule that names no hour at all
 *      fires on the same instants in every whole-hour zone and is classified
 *      out — measured, so it cannot be waved through by hand.
 *
 * Not asserted: that any particular hour is the RIGHT hour. Nothing in a
 * repository can know that 03:00 is a good time to export Cosmos. What this
 * pins is that the hour written in the code is the hour that happens, which is
 * the half that was broken.
 *
 * Reads the schedules from the real `app.timer()` registrations rather than
 * from the source text, so a schedule built at runtime cannot slip past a
 * regex. Reads Terraform as text, like timer-catalogue-sync.test.js: this has
 * to fail in CI, on a checkout, with no Azure credentials and no Terraform
 * binary.
