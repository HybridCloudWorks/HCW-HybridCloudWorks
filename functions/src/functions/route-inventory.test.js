/**
 * The route inventory — the replacement for the `firestore.rules` default-deny
 * catch-all, and the test `lib/auth/require-role.js` declares in its header as
 * *"the highest-value test in the port"*. It was declared and never written
 * (TODO.md T-103).
 *
 * Firestore had `match /{document=**} { allow read, write: if false }`, which
 * caught every path the API forgot. Azure has no equivalent: every
 * `app.http` registration defaults to `authLevel: 'anonymous'`, so one handler
 * that forgets the guard IS the vulnerability, and it is invisible — the route
 * works, which is exactly what makes it easy to ship.
 *
 * This test enumerates every registration the Functions host would see and
 * asserts three properties of each:
 *
 *   1. **Guarded or explicitly public.** Either the route is named in
 *      `PUBLIC_ROUTES` below — a deliberate, reviewed decision — or invoking it
 *      reaches one of the recognised guards (`requireRole`, `requireUser`, or
 *      the Labs agent's `requireAgent`).
 *   2. **`OPTIONS` is registered.** Without it the host 404s a preflight before
 *      any handler runs, and every authenticated call preflights because it
 *      carries `Authorization`.
 *   3. **CORS is evaluated.** A disallowed origin is refused, and a preflight is
 *      answered, before the handler runs.
 *
 * Properties 2 and 3 are what T-102 got wrong: CORS was correct and wired into
 * one route of fifty-eight. Adding a route now fails this test unless it goes
 * through `httpRoute` and either guards or is consciously added to the
 * allowlist below.
 *
 * Adding a route to `PUBLIC_ROUTES` is a security decision. It means anyone on
 * the internet can call it, with no token, forever.

 * shipped broken: the Azure Functions host keys its route table on the route
 * template ALONE, not on template + method. Two functions declaring the same
 * `route` with different `methods` are a conflict — the host starts one and
 * refuses the other with "is in error: The route specified conflicts with the
 * route defined by function X". The losing verb answers 404.
 *
 * Seven `cms/*` templates were declared two or three times each and eight
 * functions never started: list, patch and put across certifications,
 * recordings, social posts, settings, config and keyword-config, which is most
 * of what the admin UI does (TODO.md T-510). Every one of those registrations
 * passed properties 1, 2 and 3 — individually they were all fine.
 *
 * `httpRegistrations` is keyed by function NAME, which is exactly why the
 * mock could not see it: two functions sharing a route are two distinct keys.
 * The fix is `httpRouteByMethod` — one template, one registration, the method
 * fan-out inside it — and this test is what keeps a second one from appearing.
 *
 * Templates are compared with parameter names collapsed (`{id}` and `{docId}`
 * are the same template to a router) and case-folded, because ASP.NET routing
 * matches on shape, not on spelling.
