/**
 * The function inventory, held to the code (PLAT-2, #962).
 *
 * `functions/function-inventory.json` lists every function the host registers,
 * by trigger. Two workflows compare a live listing against it, through
 * `scripts/check-registered-functions.mjs`: `deploy-functions.yml` after
 * SyncTriggers, and `monitor-functions-registered.yml` on its timer. Both used
 * to ask only whether the count was above zero, so the 2026-08-21 incident (83
 * deployed, 80 registered, three timers silently down) passed both. They now
 * name every expected function that is not registered.
 *
 * A file the workflows trust is only as good as its agreement with the code,
 * so this enumerates the registrations exactly as route-inventory.test.js
 * does (mock the host, import index.js) and fails, naming each name, when the
 * two disagree in either direction:
 *
 *   - registered here but absent from the file: the deploy and the monitor
 *     would never notice that function going missing;
 *   - in the file but not registered: both would report a function missing
 *     that no deploy can ever register, which reads as an outage.
 *
 * Adding, renaming or removing a function therefore means editing the file in
 * the same change. That is the point: the expected set is reviewed, not
 * inferred from whatever the host happens to report.
 *
 * A new KIND of trigger (app.serviceBusQueue, app.eventGrid, ...) fails the
 * import below, because the mock has no such method. Add it here, to the
 * file, and to TRIGGERS in scripts/check-registered-functions.mjs together.
