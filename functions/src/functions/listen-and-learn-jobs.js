/**
 * listen-and-learn-jobs.js — episode generation as a platform job.
 *
 * Site-Main exposed this as `generateListenAndLearn`, a 540-second HTTP
 * handler. That shape does not survive the port: an Azure Functions HTTP
 * response is bounded at 230 seconds by the load balancer regardless of the
 * host's `functionTimeout`, and one certification is five model calls, five
 * syntheses and five multi-megabyte uploads. So the admin page enqueues
 * `generate-listen-and-learn` and polls (frontend/src/lib/jobs.js), exactly as
 * the RSS ingest does.
 *
 * The run still saves area by area, so a timeout leaves the finished episodes
 * behind as drafts rather than losing the work and the spend.
 *
 * The same job runs a source-grounded episode (#433): a payload carrying
 * `sources` is one episode built from the owner's pages and videos, parsed by
 * `parseSourceEpisodePayload` and run by `generateSourceEpisode`, and needs no
 * study guide URL. The admin page queues it through
 * `POST cms/listen-and-learn/source-episode` (listen-and-learn/handlers.js), which
 * validates the list before the job exists; the worker validates it again.

 * `estimateSpeechCostUsd` treats as bytes; Gemini's duration is derived from
 * bytes at a deliberately slow speaking rate, so this over-estimates. The
 * episode count is the areas requested or, when the guide has not been parsed
 * to know, the most a run may generate. The run cannot spend more than this
 * figure on speech; it usually spends less.
 *
 * The Listen & Learn product only — Gemini or Azure AI Speech, never
 * ElevenLabs, whatever keys are present (speech/index.js). `provider` is null
 * when no speech provider will run, and `reason` says why, because the two
 * causes call for different actions: `not_configured` (no key at all — the
 * transcript-only state, not an error) or `pin_unavailable`
 * (`LISTEN_AND_LEARN_TTS_PROVIDER` names a provider that is not configured,
 * not known, or not this product's — the run will still go ahead, and its
 * audio step will fail with a sentence naming the pin).
 *
 * The model is the `listenAndLearnSpeech` task's (ADR 0034 slice 5, #860):
 * the worker reads it from the selection document when it runs
 * (`resolveRunModel`), and this hook is synchronous and sees only the
 * payload, so it cannot know which model that is. It does not guess:
 * `model` is null, `modelSource` is `'task'`, `modelNote` says where the
 * choice lives, and the ceiling is priced at the DEARER of the two Gemini
 * TTS models so that it is still a ceiling whichever one the task resolves
 * to (Copilot on #462). A `ttsModel` in the payload is ignored, never
 * echoed back.
