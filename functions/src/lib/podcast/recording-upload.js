/**
 * Upload audio, have Plaud Embedded transcribe it, keep the transcript (#442).
 *
 *   browser → POST cms/podcast/recordings/upload (base64 JSON)
 *           → blob podcast/uploads/<uuid>.<ext>
 *           → job transcribe-recording-upload { uploadPath, title }
 *           → Plaud Embedded: create, poll to SUCCESS
 *           → recordings/<uuid> { source: 'plaud-embedded', segments, … }
 *
 * The transcript is the artefact worth keeping — it is what "Script this"
 * feeds — and the audio is kept only because Plaud has to fetch it from
 * somewhere. That somewhere is the public media route: the storage account
 * denies direct and SAS reads by network rule, so `mediaUrlFor` is the only
 * URL Plaud can read (plaud-embedded.js says more). The path is server-minted
 * — a v4 UUID, never caller-chosen — so the URL is unguessable, and it is
 * still unauthenticated for as long as the blob exists.
 *
 * **So the blob does not exist for long.** Two things bound it:
 *
 *   1. The job deletes the upload as soon as the transcription reaches a
 *      terminal state — SUCCESS, FAILURE, REVOKED, or a submission that never
 *      happened — in a `finally`, best-effort (a failed delete is logged by
 *      job id and never changes the outcome). The one case that keeps it is
 *      a poll that ran out of time (`PLAUD_EMBEDDED_TIMEOUT`): Plaud may still
 *      be reading the file, and the transcription can be re-read by id for
 *      seven days.
 *   2. A lifecycle rule in infra/storage.tf (`expire-recording-uploads`)
 *      deletes anything under `podcast/uploads/` seven days after creation —
 *      the blob a dead worker or an undelivered message left behind. Seven,
 *      because Plaud retains the transcription for seven days, after which
 *      there is nothing the audio could be re-read for.
 *
 * **Why this route writes to a generated-media container.** blob-paths.js
 * keeps `PUBLIC_MEDIA_CONTAINERS ∩ UPLOAD_CONTAINERS` empty so an editor
 * cannot put an arbitrary file behind an anonymous URL through the generic
 * upload route. This route is deliberately narrower than that one: it
 * accepts three audio media types and nothing else, checks the extension
 * against the declared type, refuses before storing when Plaud Embedded is
 * not configured (an upload nothing can transcribe is a file nobody wanted),
 * and names the blob itself. `podcast` stays out of `UPLOAD_CONTAINERS`, so
 * the generic route still cannot reach it.
 *
 * **Limits.** Base64 JSON, the shape admin-uploads.js already handles, with
 * the same three checks in the same order (Content-Length, base64 length,
 * decoded length) and a 40 MiB ceiling: an hour at 64 kbps is about 29 MB,
 * and the Plaud device records at or below that. A raw-bytes body would
 * halve the memory cost; it would also need a second CORS header allowance
 * and a second upload contract in the browser, which this slice does not
 * take on.
 *
 * The job runs under the platform-jobs timeout, polling every ten seconds
 * (a tenth of Plaud's 60 req/min). Plaud retains the result for seven days,
 * so a job that times out still leaves the `transcriptionId` in its error
 * for an operator to read back by hand.
