/**
 * elevenlabs-admin.js: the podcast voice's account, on the Audio tab of the
 * Platform settings page, and the owner's cheap live check (#432; ADR 0029
 * §2a, amended 2026-09-26).
 *
 * Four routes, all `editor`, the level of the routes that generate podcast
 * audio (which spend far more than any of these):
 *
 *   GET  cms/podcast/elevenlabs          the plan, credits used / limit, the
 *                                        reset date, what the last render
 *                                        billed, and the last sample to
 *                                        replay (`lastSample`)
 *   POST cms/podcast/elevenlabs/sample   renders SAMPLE_DIALOGUE, two turns
 *                                        and under 300 characters, through
 *                                        the real provider, in the saved
 *                                        podcast voices
 *   GET  cms/podcast/elevenlabs/voices   the voices this key may list, each
 *                                        marked usable on the current plan or
 *                                        not, and why (#725)
 *   GET  cms/podcast/elevenlabs/voices/{voiceId}/preview
 *                                        that voice's preview MP3, fetched
 *                                        from ElevenLabs's preview host only
 *                                        (#725; the allowlist is in
 *                                        speech/elevenlabs-preview.js)
 *
 * The two voice routes spend no credits: a listing and a preview are reads.
 * The owner picks two voices by ear with them and saves the choice through
 * the Platform settings route (`podcast-voices`); the live check and every
 * episode read that choice (podcast/voice-settings.js).
 *
 * ## Not configured is an answer
 *
 * With no `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` the status route answers 200 with
 * `configured: false` and the sentence naming the secret. It does not answer
 * with an error: an unseeded key is a state the page shows, the way the
 * Integrations page shows "Not configured". The sample route cannot do its
 * job without the key, so it answers 503 with the same sentence and sends
 * nothing.
 *
 * ## The live check spends about 300 credits, never more
 *
 * The sample is fixed here. The caller sends no text, so the route cannot be
 * used to spend the month. It goes through `synthesizeDialogue` with the
 * `podcast` product, which is the same path an episode takes: the product
 * switch, the pin, the credit pre-flight, the voices, the model and the
 * chunker. So a pass means an episode would reach ElevenLabs the same way.
 * Its MP3 is stored at one fixed path in the `podcast` container, overwritten
 * by the next check. It is served the way every transcript's audio is,
 * anonymously, through the media route. The URL carries a version because
 * that route answers `immutable`. The usage row is its own source,
 * `podcast:sample`, so the check never reads as episode spend.
 *
 * ## Replaying the last sample costs nothing
 *
 * Owner request 2026-09-27: two live checks were spent only to test playback,
 * because the page showed a player only for a check run in the same session.
 * So a stored sample is recorded in `admin_config/podcast_last_sample`: its
 * URL with the version, the two voice ids (and names, when this instance's
 * voice listing is cached; nothing is listed to find them), the characters
 * billed and the time. Only the latest is kept, as the blob is. The status
 * route returns it as `lastSample` after checking the blob still exists (a
 * HEAD on our own storage), and the page plays it from the media route. None
 * of that reaches ElevenLabs. A sample stored before the record existed is
 * still returned (`recorded: false`), from the blob, the newest
 * `podcast:sample` usage row, and the saved voices when they were saved
 * before that row.
 *
 * ## "Credits left" after the check
 *
 * ElevenLabs may update `character_count` a moment after the request that
 * spent it. So the figure reported is the lower of a fresh read and "before,
 * minus what the response said it billed". A lagging read then cannot report
 * the credits as unspent.
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 * Each route is a module-level function taking the resolved dependencies;
 * `createElevenLabsHandlers` only binds them. Small functions, each doing one
 * step, rather than one closure holding both routes.
