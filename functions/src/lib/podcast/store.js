/**
 * Persist podcast transcripts — the podcast's own product (#435, #432).
 *
 * A transcript is a two-host script read from something the site already
 * published, plus the audio rendered from it. Two sources feed it: published
 * articles (this slice) and Plaud recordings (#434, later). Both land here,
 * in `podcast_transcripts`, and NOT in `listen_and_learn_episodes`. The
 * owner's ruling (2026-09-08, on #435) is the reason and it is editorial, not
 * technical: Listen & Learn is the Learn section's exam-prep playlist,
 * surfaced per provider, and content transcripts are the written catalogue
 * read aloud for the podcast. Storing the second inside the first's container
 * would have had every Learn playlist reader start serving article episodes.
 * So the two products keep two containers, and the shape below borrows from
 * `listen-and-learn/publish.js` without sharing its storage.
 *
 * Layout
 *   Cosmos   podcast_transcripts/article_{slug} @ /id       — one per article
 *            podcast_transcripts/plaud_{recordingId}          — one per Plaud
 *                                                              library recording
 *            podcast_transcripts/recording_{id}               — one per stored
 *                                                              recording (#442)
 *   Blob     podcast/article/{slug}.mp3, podcast/plaud/{recordingId}.mp3,
 *            podcast/recording/{id}.mp3
 *
 * Every write keys on a source descriptor (`describeArticleSource`,
 * `describeRecordingSource`) so the three kinds share one document shape and
 * one set of writers; the `article`-shaped functions are wrappers kept for
 * the callers that predate the second kind.
 *
 * `/id` rather than a set partition because a transcript has no set: the id is
 * globally unique by construction — `article_` plus the article's slug, which
 * the publish path already keeps unique across the catalogue — so the
 * per-partition uniqueness `listen_and_learn_episodes` needs for repeated area
 * slugs does not arise. Regeneration is therefore idempotent for free, and a
 * regeneration is a whole-document replace, exactly as `saveEpisode` does it:
 * the new draft must not inherit the approval of the version it replaced.
 *
 * `sourceProvider` is recorded when the article names a cloud provider and
 * left null otherwise. It is NOT a refusal condition. The earlier analysis
 * that refused an unknown provider was reasoning about the Learn container,
 * whose listings key on `provider`; nothing here does, and the hub (#442)
 * lists transcripts by date.
 *
 * The container is provisioned by Terraform from infra/cosmos-containers.json.
 * Until that apply runs, every write here answers 404 — `saveTranscript` turns
 * that into a sentence naming the container and the apply, because a
 * generation that spent on a model call and then "failed to save" with a bare
 * `Resource Not Found` sends someone looking at the wrong thing.
