/**
 * The publish pipeline — publishContent (batch, up to 25 ids) and its
 * single-item core processPublishContent, ported from Site-Main
 * cms-functions.js (:111-160, :218-360, :1337-1600, :6657-6745).
 *
 * Sequence per item, exactly as the source: publishable-status check (the one
 * canPublishFromStatus table) → quality gate → image gate (each persisting
 * its failed report onto the doc) → slug resolution (see resolveSlug) →
 * metadata validation (new publishes only) → cover trigger → the publish
 * write → forge format stats → version snapshot.
 *
 * Adaptations, each deliberate:
 *   - The scrapedImages re-hosting step (`_internal_archiveScrapedImageRefs`)
 *     is NOT ported: it re-uploads scraped assets between Firebase Storage
 *     paths, which belongs to the asset-migration phase. When refs need
 *     archiving the item still publishes and a warning is surfaced in the
 *     batch results, so nothing silently changes.
 *   - Inline body images ARE re-hosted, since 2026-09-06 (issue #374): every
 *     external `<img>` / `![](…)` URL in any body field is fetched
 *     through the guarded fetcher, stored under the article id in the public
 *     `covers` container and rewritten to the site's media path. A URL that
 *     fails is left in place and counted in the `inlineImages` summary the
 *     completed step writes; if the step itself throws, it is logged and the
 *     article publishes untouched with no summary. Nothing here can fail a
 *     publish. See ./inline-images.js. Injected as `inlineImages`; absent,
 *     nothing runs.
 *   - `params.reason === REHOST_IMAGES_REASON` (the #374 backfill, from
 *     POST cms/content/rehost-images) is a republish that touches NOTHING but
 *     the body fields and their `inlineImages` summary. A full republish of a
 *     live article would also re-run the gates, re-arm the cover trigger on an
 *     article without one, re-arm the social-caption trigger on one that never
 *     posted, rewrite Live from the caller's markLive, and re-stamp the
 *     publish dates and URLs — none of which sixteen articles need for their
 *     images to stop hotlinking. The branch shares the read, the status table,
 *     the ETag precondition and the version snapshot, and nothing else.
 *   - `params.reason === SET_SLUG_REASON` (issue #400, from POST
 *     cms/content/slug) is the second such reason, and the one the note above
 *     anticipated. It gives a published article the slug an operator asks for
 *     and lets the four URL fields follow in the same patch, writing nothing
 *     else — and it REFUSES a slug another document holds rather than
 *     suffixing it, the one place a set-slug has to be stricter than a
 *     publish. See SET_SLUG_REASON for why a FULL republish cannot do this job
 *     on the very articles that need it.
 *   - bumpForgeStats' FieldValue.increment becomes read-modify-patch on the
 *     whole totals/formats objects — formatKey is user-influenced text, and
 *     writing whole objects avoids dotted-path escaping entirely.
 *   - Timestamps/publish markers are ISO strings (the migrated shape).
 *   - The source's uniqueSlug becomes pure `resolveSlug` plus the
 *     `slugHolders` probe (issue #400). Same shape — keep the bare slug when
 *     the probe finds no other holder, suffix with the document id otherwise,
 *     and never let a lookup failure block a publish — with the two gaps that
 *     put three articles on one URL closed: the probe now reads `c.Slug` as
 *     well as `c.slug`, and a republish runs it instead of reusing its stored
 *     slug unexamined. The residual a read cannot close is documented at
 *     resolveSlug.

 * three articles on the contested URL does not merely do more than they need —
 * it FAILS. They arrived from Site-Main already published and have never been
 * through this pipeline's gates: the one still serving the URL scores 68
 * against a threshold of 82 (238 words, no inline modules) and carries no hero
 * image, so the quality gate refuses it and the image gate refuses it after
 * that. A set-slug built on the full path would therefore write a failed
 * quality report onto the article and leave its URL exactly as broken as it
 * found it. Re-litigating an article's body is not what correcting its URL is
 * for, and the article is already live either way.
 *
 * So this branch runs the probe and the two URL rules and nothing else: no
 * quality gate, no image gate, no cover or social trigger, no dates, no forge
 * stats, no Live rewrite, no status change. Like the re-host branch it shares
 * the read, the status table, the ETag precondition and the version snapshot.
 *
 * It is also STRICTER than a publish in the one place that matters. A publish
 * that finds a clash suffixes the slug and carries on, because refusing would
 * block a publish; a set-slug that finds one REFUSES, because the operator
 * asked for a specific URL and silently giving them a different one is how a
 * URL correction becomes the next URL surprise.

/**
 * The slug a publish writes. Pure: the caller runs the probe, this decides.
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG (issue #400). Three published articles share one slug, so
 * two of them have no URL. None of the three was assigned that slug here: they
 * arrived from Site-Main already `contentStatus: published`, and the branch
 * that reuses a stored slug never probed at all. Two things follow, and both
 * are the rules below:
 *
 *   - EVERY publish probes, republishes included. Keeping the URL an article
 *     already serves is right; keeping one another document holds is not.
 *   - The probe reads `c.slug` AND `c.Slug`. They are two fields with two
 *     different values on ten of the twenty-two published articles, and the
 *     manifest routes on `slug || Slug` (scripts/build-content-manifest.mjs),
 *     so a document whose site slug lives in `Slug` alone holds a URL that
 *     `c.slug` on its own cannot see.
 *
 * WHAT THIS STILL DOES NOT PROVE, said plainly. A clean probe is a read, and a
 * read cannot establish that a slug is free at the moment of the write. Three
 * callers publish independently — the batch route, the scheduled publisher
 * (lib/scheduled-publish.js) and the Telegram approve worker
 * (functions/publish-jobs.js) — so two first publishes of two documents whose
 * titles slugify alike can both probe clean and both write the bare slug. That
 * residual is deliberate and it is bounded: the manifest build refuses to route
 * the duplicate (#386), so one article is temporarily unreachable rather than
 * two articles being served at one URL, and `scripts/report-slug-collisions.mjs`
 * names it from a checkout. Renaming one article in the CMS recovers it.
 * Suffixing every slug instead would close that window and cost every future
 * URL its readable form — and once articles are indexed at suffixed URLs, going
 * back breaks links, which is the harm that does not recover. If that trade is
 * ever wanted, it is one line here: return the suffixed slug unconditionally
 * when `reuse` is false.
 *
 * `holders` is what the probe found, or `null` when it could not answer. The
 * two paths read `null` differently, on purpose:
 *
 *   - a FIRST assignment treats it as "not established" and takes the
 *     always-suffixed slug — ugly but always unique, and the publish is never
 *     blocked by a lookup failure (the source's rule, kept);
 *   - a REPUBLISH keeps the URL the article already serves, because a failed
 *     lookup is not evidence of a clash and inventing a new URL out of one
 *     would break every inbound link to an article that was fine.
