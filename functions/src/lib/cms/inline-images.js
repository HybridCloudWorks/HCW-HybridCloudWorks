/**
 * Re-host the images an article body hotlinks (issue #374).
 *
 * Curated articles keep their body as ingested, upstream `<img>` and
 * `![alt](url)` references included. The cover already re-hosts — the
 * publish-time cover trigger writes to blob storage and the page serves it
 * from `/api/public/media/…` — but nothing did the same for the body, and on
 * 2026-09-06 the published-pages audit found an article whose two body images
 * loaded with zero natural width: the publisher refuses cross-site hotlinking.
 * The reader saw two empty boxes.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES. At publish time, every external image URL in the rendered
 * body field is fetched once through the same guarded fetcher the cover
 * mirror uses (`triggers/fetch-image.js`: protocol and private-IP checks,
 * redirect cap, size cap, timeout), stored under the article's id in the
 * public `covers` container, and the body's references are rewritten to the
 * site's own media path. A URL that cannot be fetched — or that the fetcher
 * refuses because what came back is not an image (#415) — is left exactly as
 * it was, the alt text still renders, and it is recorded on the document, so
 * the editor can see what did not come across instead of finding out from a
 * reader.
 *
 * WHY IT NEVER FAILS A PUBLISH. The image is decoration on an article that
 * passed the quality and image gates already; a publisher's hotlink policy is
 * not a reason to hold the article. Every failure is per-URL, caught, and
 * summarised in `inlineImages` on the document.
 *
 * WHY THE BLOB NAME IS A HASH OF THE URL. Re-publishing the same article must
 * not upload the same image twice, and two articles hotlinking the same asset
 * must not collide — the path is `<contentId>/inline/<sha256(url)[0:16]>.<ext>`,
 * so a republish overwrites its own copy and nothing else.
 *
 * Pure core (`findInlineImageUrls`, `rewriteBody`, `inlineBlobPath`) over an
 * injected edge (`storage.uploadBlob`, `fetchImage`), the house style in this
 * directory. `createDefaultInlineImageRehoster` in inline-images-default.js
 * wires the real edge for the three publish call sites.
