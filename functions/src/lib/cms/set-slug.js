/**
 * POST cms/content/slug — give a published article the slug it should have
 * had, and let its URLs follow (#400).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. #403 made new collisions impossible and made a republish
 * move an article off a slug another document holds. It cannot give an article
 * the RIGHT slug, and three published articles need exactly that: they share
 * one title, so they were published onto one URL and two of them are
 * unreachable. Nothing in the admin UI edited a slug, so there was no operator
 * path at all — the fix was a script that would leave nothing behind for the
 * next time, and there will be a next time.
 *
 * WHY NOT updateContentItem, WHICH ALREADY ACCEPTED A SLUG. It would have
 * "worked", in the worst sense. `slug` was on no denylist there and matched
 * none of that route's normalizers, so it fell through to the generic string
 * branch and was stored EXACTLY as sent: `{ slug: '  Hello World!!  ' }`
 * round-tripped with its spaces, its capitals and its punctuation intact, and
 * nothing asked whether another document already held the value. A control
 * built on that route would write a URL the pipeline could never produce, onto
 * a URL another article is already serving. So the route is fixed rather than
 * worked around — slug/Slug joined FORBIDDEN_CONTENT_UPDATE_KEYS in the same
 * change — and a site URL now has exactly one writer, this one.
 *
 * WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES is one narrow republish through the publish pipeline
 * (SET_SLUG_REASON in ./publish.js): probe `c.slug OR c.Slug`, refuse a slug
 * another document holds, refuse an article whose published path cannot be
 * computed, then write the cased slug pair and curatedSubpagePath /
 * slugPageUrl / publishedUrl / publicUrl in ONE patch conditioned on the
 * read's ETag. The URLs are derived by `resolveCuratedSubpagePath` and
 * `toPublicUrl`, the same two functions the ordinary publish write uses.
 *
 * IT REFUSES RATHER THAN HALF-COMPLETING. Owner decision on #412: this route
 * exists to make a live URL correct, so an article with neither a curated path
 * nor an inferable provider is a 409 — writing the slug and no URLs would
 * leave a panel reporting a move beside a link still pointing at the old URL,
 * which is the state the route was built to remove. See
 * `resolveSlugPublishPath` for why that diverges from the publish write on
 * purpose.
 *
 * The `fields` array in the response is still the authority on what a given
 * write touched, since keys already holding the right value are dropped.
 *
 * ONE ATOMIC STEP RATHER THAN TWO. Setting the slug and moving the URLs are
 * one operation here on purpose: as two writes there is a window in which the
 * article holds its new slug at its old URL, and the operator's recovery from
 * a failure in the second write is to reason about a half-applied document.
 * Nothing is hidden by that choice — every refusal below names its reason and
 * says that nothing was written, and a success reports the previous slug, the
 * new slug and the resulting public URL.
 *
 * NORMALISATION IS SERVER-SIDE ONLY. `slugify` lives in ./publish.js and there
 * is no package shared with `frontend/`, so a client-side preview would mean a
 * second copy of the one function whose output IS the URL. The response names
 * `requested` beside `slug` instead, so the operator sees what they typed and
 * what was stored.

 * normalises to nothing), 404 (no such document), 409 (another document holds
 * the slug, or this one is not published) and 503 (the probe could not
 * answer). The `= 500` default is therefore for an error path that does not
 * exist yet, not for any of these — which is the point of naming them. It read
 * as a nicety until it was not: a missing document arrived here without a
 * status and answered 500, telling an operator who pasted a stale id that the
 * server was broken. Any new refusal added to the branch must bring its status
 * with it, or it inherits the same lie.
 *
 * A `skipped` result is a 200 — the truthful answer to "set it to what it
 * already is", and to a lost ETag race, which the publish pipeline has always
 * reported as a skip rather than an error. Reporting either as a failure would
 * train an operator to ignore the panel.
