/**
 * notify-test.js — "Test Telegram": one message through the shared notifier,
 * on demand, from Platform Settings → Reminders (owner brief 2026-10-06).
 *
 * The day the brief was written, every owner notification had been failing
 * since morning because the owner's Telegram account had the bot blocked, and
 * the only record was a trace line. The delivery alert (observability.tf,
 * alert-telegram-delivery) now pages on a refusal; this route is the other
 * half, a way to prove the channel works right now, from the page that
 * depends on it, and to read Telegram's own reason when it does not.
 *
 * The notifier is used as every other caller uses it — same cooldown, same
 * source table (`sendTestNotification` has had a display name since the
 * port) — so what this proves is the production path, not a parallel one. A
 * second test inside the fifteen-minute cooldown is answered `cooldown`, which
 * is itself information: the previous one went.
 *
 * Editor, the same role as the Reminders sheet. The message names the actor
 * by display name only; an email is never put on the wire to Telegram.
