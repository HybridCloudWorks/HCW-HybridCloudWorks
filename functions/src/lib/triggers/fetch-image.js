 *
 * Ported from Site-Main `fetchImage` / `validateUrl` / `isExternalUrlString`
 * (index.js, 088f458). The SSRF guard is the point: http(s) only, no
 * localhost, the hostname resolved to IPv4 and refused if private — and
 * re-checked on every redirect hop (redirects are followed manually, up to
 * five), so a public host cannot bounce the fetch onto the private network.
 *
 * The second guard is the media type (issue #415). Until then the fetcher
 * returned whatever bytes came back and let the caller name the blob, and the
 * only mapping from type to extension defaulted to `png` — so a `video/mp4`
 * hotlinked from an `<img src>` in an article body would have been stored as
 * a `.png`, and nothing downstream would have noticed: the blob exists, the
 * rewrite succeeds, and the page renders an `<img>` at a file that will never
 * paint. #413 closed the same hole on the frontend, where only the URL can be
 * tested; here the response itself is in hand, so the gate is on the measured
 * `Content-Type`, which is strictly stronger than an extension guess.

 * (`image/tiff`, `image/heic`) no browser paints into an `<img>`. Refusing an
 * unmapped image type rather than defaulting its extension is deliberate —
 * a default is precisely the silent mislabel #415 is about, and a refusal is
 * visible (it lands in `inlineImages.failed` and in the log), so the day a
 * real format shows up we add a line here instead of finding a broken image.
