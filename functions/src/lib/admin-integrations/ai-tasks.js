/**
 * ai-tasks.js — the Tasks tab's two reads of production (ADR 0034 §4, slice
 * 4, #859), beside the selection document's GET and PUT in ai-routing.js:
 *
 *   GET cms/ai-routing/effective — the resolver's answer for every task over
 *   the configuration the router reads (router.js effectiveSelection: the
 *   same loader, cache dropped first). The browser cannot import the
 *   resolver, and a copy of it on the page would be the second list this
 *   page has already had once; so the page renders this answer and never
 *   computes its own. effective-selection.contract.test.js holds the
 *   answer for a task equal to selectChain's on the same documents.
 *
 *   POST cms/ai-routing/test/{task} — the task's effective chain walked with
 *   the Test's prompt and caps (proxy.js testTaskCandidate) until one
 *   candidate answers: which one did, how fast, and why each one above it
 *   did not. The chain is the resolver's, so the policy locks hold here as
 *   they do for a real call — the public explain route is never tested
 *   against the trial tier (ai-tasks.test.js).
 *
 * A MEDIA TASK'S TEST SPENDS NOTHING (ADR 0034 slice 5, #860). The Test
 * above sends a one-word prompt down a chat chain, which costs a fraction
 * of a cent; a voice or an image model has no one-word prompt, and the
 * cheapest audio or image is real money on an account the Usage tab can
 * see. So for a task whose modality is tts, image, stt, ocr or embedding
 * the Test resolves the chain and answers the candidate it WOULD use, with
 * the resolver's reason, and never calls the provider: `dryRun: true`,
 * `wouldUse: { provider, model, why }` (null when nothing is eligible),
 * `answeredBy: null`, `skipped: []`. The page says so on the line.
 *
 * Each handler body is a module-level function over `ctx` (guard, store,
 * now, uuid, clock, ai, effectiveSelection); the factory at the bottom only
 * wires them.
