/**
 * Write one Key Vault secret, and ask the platform to re-read its references.
 *
 * ## This module can write and cannot read, on purpose
 *
 * There is no `getSecret` here, and adding one would defeat the feature this
 * serves. The API-keys page promises that a pasted credential cannot be pulled
 * back out; a read function in this module is the first thing a future change
 * would reach for to "just show the last four characters".
 *
 * That promise is also enforced BELOW the code: the Function App's identity
 * holds a custom role with `Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/setSecret/action`
 * and nothing else — not `getSecret`, not `delete`, not `purge`. If this module
 * grew a reader it would get a 403, not a secret.
 *
 * The honest limit of that: a secret that HAS resolved into an app setting is
 * already in `process.env`, so the app can read the values it is actively
 * using by definition. The set-only role stops it reading other secrets, other
 * VERSIONS of the same secret, and anything it has no reference for — and it
 * stops a compromised app destroying the vault's contents, which
 * `Key Vault Secrets Officer` would allow.
 *
 * ## No SDK
 *
 * `@azure/keyvault-secrets` was removed from this codebase when GCP pricing
 * stopped needing a runtime vault client. Setting a secret is one authenticated
 * PUT, so it comes back as `fetch` rather than as a dependency — the same
 * decision, for the same reason, as the one that removed it.
 *
 * ## Why the refresh call exists and why it must never throw
 *
 * App Service caches Key Vault references and refetches them every 24 hours.
 * Without a nudge, a pasted key is in the vault but not in the running app for
 * up to a day, and the page would look broken. The documented nudge is a POST
 * to the site's `config/configreferences/appsettings/refresh` endpoint.
 *
 * It is best-effort by design. If the grant is missing, ARM is throttling, or
 * the endpoint changes, the SECRET IS ALREADY SAFELY WRITTEN — the only cost is
 * that the value goes live on the 24-hour cycle instead of now. Letting a
 * refresh failure fail the request would report "seeding failed" for a seeding
 * that succeeded, and the operator's next move would be to paste it again.
