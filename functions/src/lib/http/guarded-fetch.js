/**
 * guarded-fetch.js — the one outbound fetch for a URL a caller did not choose.
 *
 * An editor's "forge this page", a KB document URL, a scraped `<img src>`: all
 * of these are attacker-influenced strings that this Function App — which sits
 * inside the integration subnet and holds a managed identity — is asked to
 * fetch. A bare `fetch` on such a string is a server-side request forgery
 * primitive: `http://10.0.0.5/`, `http://169.254.169.254/`, or a public host
 * whose redirect lands on either, and the response body comes back to the
 * caller through whatever the feature renders.
 *
 * The guard here is the one `triggers/fetch-image.js` has carried since T-734
 * for images, lifted out so every URL-taking feature uses the same primitive
 * instead of its own `fetch` (the 2026-10-06 estate review found the article
 * scraper and the supporting-document fetch doing exactly that, AP-B2), and
 * tightened on PR #889's review:
 *
 *   - http(s) only; `localhost` and every IPv6 literal refused by name, and a
 *     name that does not resolve is a refusal too (fail closed: a host the
 *     guard cannot classify is not fetched and not handed to a fallback);
 *   - the hostname resolved to IPv4 before the request, and refused when the
 *     address is loopback, link-local (the cloud metadata range), RFC 1918,
 *     carrier-grade NAT, multicast/reserved, or Azure's platform address
 *     168.63.129.16 (WireServer, which answers plain HTTP);
 *   - the connection is PINNED to the address that passed: the request is
 *     dispatched through an undici Agent whose DNS lookup returns that one
 *     answer, so a rebinding host (public A record for the check, private
 *     one for the connect) gets the address the guard saw, while Host and
 *     TLS SNI stay the original hostname;
 *   - redirects followed manually, up to `maxRedirects`, every hop
 *     re-validated and re-pinned — and, with `httpsOnly`, refused on any hop
 *     that is not https, so an https request cannot be redirected down to
 *     plain http (the MCP OAuth flow, lib/ai/mcp-oauth.js, sets it);
 *   - one deadline over the whole exchange, body included, and a byte cap on
 *     the body, so a server that sends headers and then stalls, or streams
 *     without end, is cut off rather than held open.
 *
 * Because the body must be read under the deadline, this helper returns the
 * bytes, not a live Response: `{ response, buffer, text() }`. Resolution and
 * the dispatcher factory are injectable for tests and nothing else.
