/**
 * fetch-with-timeout.js — the one outbound-HTTP helper (T-712).
 *
 * Node's `fetch` has NO default timeout. A hung socket therefore hangs the
 * caller forever, and several of this platform's callers run inside change-feed
 * handlers, where "forever" means the lease is never checkpointed and every
 * subsequent change on that container queues behind the stuck invocation. One
 * unresponsive third party stalls the pipeline instead of failing one document.
 *
 * The behaviour was never unknown here — `content/scrape.js`, `ai/router.js`,
 * `ai/mcp.js`, `triggers/fetch-image.js` and `timers/link-check.js` each had
 * their own AbortController. What was missing was the same discipline on the
 * calls to Replicate, Publer and Telegram. This module is that helper lifted
 * out so there is one implementation to reason about and one place to change
 * the semantics.
 *
 * Deliberately thin: it does not retry, does not inspect status codes, and does
 * not parse bodies. Callers differ on all three (Replicate polls, Telegram must
 * never retry-storm, Publer reconciles later), so a helper that decided those
 * things would be wrong for most of them.
