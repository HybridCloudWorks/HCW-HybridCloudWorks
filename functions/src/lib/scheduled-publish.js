/**
 * The read side of `scheduledPublishDate` (TODO.md T-301).
 *
 * The write side has been complete since the migration: `saveContentSchedule`
 * validates and persists the date, `BlogReviewBoard` renders the picker, and
 * Calendar and Queue display the result. Nothing consumed it. An operator
 * scheduled a post, the server accepted it, the UI confirmed it, and the post
 * never went live — with no error and no alert anywhere. A feature that is
 * complete except for the part that does the work is worse than an absent one,
 * because it is indistinguishable from a working one until someone checks.
 *
 * Design notes, each load-bearing:
 *
 *   - **It calls `processPublishContent`, it does not reimplement publishing.**
 *     The status gate, quality gate, image gate, slug resolution, cover
 *     trigger and version snapshot *are* the publish semantics. A timer with
 *     its own copy would drift from the operator path, and the drift would
 *     show up as posts that publish differently depending on who published
 *     them.
 *   - **The date is compared as a string, and that is safe only because both
 *     sides are `Date#toISOString()` output** — fixed width, UTC, `Z`-suffixed,
 *     so lexicographic order is chronological order. `saveContentSchedule`
 *     produces its value that way and so does this module. A local-time or
 *     offset-bearing string would break the comparison silently, which is why
 *     the query also requires `IS_STRING`.
 *   - **`ORDER BY c.scheduledPublishDate` is allowed here**, despite the rule
 *     against ordering on possibly-missing fields that applies elsewhere in
 *     this codebase. That rule exists because Cosmos drops documents lacking
 *     the sort key; here the `WHERE` clause already requires the field to be
 *     present and a string, so the set being ordered is exactly the set that
 *     has it. Do not copy the exemption without copying the `WHERE` clause.
 *   - **The schedule is cleared after publishing.** Without that, every tick
 *     re-matches the same document forever. It would not look like a failure —
 *     `processPublishContent` treats a republish as legitimate — it would look
 *     like version-history spam accumulating every fifteen minutes.
