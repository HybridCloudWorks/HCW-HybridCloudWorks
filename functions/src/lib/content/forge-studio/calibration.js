Return strict JSON with keys:
- wordSoupAdditions: array of short third-person notes (max 15) capturing the author's perspective, recurring themes, opinions and domain anchors, each usable verbatim inside a "who this author is" context block.
- styleHints: array of short imperative style rules (max 10) an AI drafter should follow to sound like this author (e.g. sentence length habits, how they use examples, what they avoid).
- recurringPhrases: array of short phrases (max 10) the author genuinely reuses, worth keeping available.
