/**
 * What the API-keys page may seed, in the sections it presents.
 *
 * ## Why a list in code when `06-seed-secret.ps1` reads `infra/main.tf`
 *
 * That script runs on an operator's desktop with the repository checked out.
 * The Function App does not have `infra/main.tf` at run time, so the catalogue
 * has to travel in the bundle. A list in code can drift from Terraform, and
 * drift here is the specific failure Required-Inputs §4.5 describes: app settings are
 * `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`, vault secrets are `UPPER-KEBAB-CASE` because Key Vault
 * forbids underscores, and a mismatch resolves to nothing. The app deploys
 * clean and a missing credential presents as missing *data*, days later, in a
 * feature nobody was looking at.
 *
 * So `secret-catalog.test.js` reads `infra/main.tf` and asserts this table is
 * exactly the set of `@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=…secrets/NAME)` references
 * it declares, with the setting names paired as Terraform pairs them. Add a
 * reference without adding it here — or spell either name wrong — and CI fails
 * on a checkout with no Azure credentials and no Terraform binary. The page can
 * therefore never offer a secret the application cannot read.
 *
 * ## Why the page cannot invent a new name
 *
 * A secret with no `@Microsoft.KeyVault(…)` app setting pointing at it is
 * unreachable by application code — no setting, no environment variable,
 * nothing to read. Seeding one would put a live credential in the vault that
 * nothing consumes and nobody owns, which is how orphaned credentials happen.
 * Adding a *new* kind of key stays a code change, because the code has to learn
 * to read it in the same change.

/**
 * Every seedable secret.
 *
 * `setting` is the app-setting name (what `process.env` holds); `secret` is the
 * Key Vault secret name (what gets written). Both are asserted against
 * `infra/main.tf`. `probe` names the reporter whose verdict can turn this
 * light red.
 *
 * `null` is the honest default and most entries have it. A non-null probe is a
 * PROMISE that something reports this credential's health, and the page prints
 * "no liveness check for this one" beside a green light that has none. Two
 * things report today, both through `lib/key-verdict.js`, which is what
 * distinguishes a rejected credential (401/403) from a bad request:
 * `ai/router.js` for its three providers, and the Publer client and proxy for
 * BOTH `PUBLER_API_KEY` and `PUBLER_WORKSPACE_ID` (#358). Only those may carry
 * a probe, and `secret-catalog.test.js` holds that. Wiring a new reporter and
 * setting a probe is one change, not two.
 *
 * The workspace id gained a probe on 2026-09-09, and the reason is worth
 * keeping: Publer answers 401 when the WORKSPACE ID is wrong and 403 when the
 * KEY is, which is the reverse of its own documentation and was measured
 * against the live API. Reporting both against the key meant a wrong workspace
 * id turned the key red, and two days went into reminting a key that was fine.
 * An identifier that can be wrong on its own, and that an upstream service
 * will tell you about, deserves its own light.
