/**
 * The API-keys page: seed a credential from the admin portal, never read one back.
 *
 * ## The problem
 *
 * Rotating a key meant opening a Key Vault firewall window for your own IP,
 * running `scripts/cutover/06-seed-secret.ps1` from a desktop with the Azure CLI
 * signed in, and closing the window again. Three steps, one of which leaves the
 * production vault open to the internet if the operator walks away — a mistake
 * this repository has already made once. The app itself has none of that
 * problem: it is inside the integration subnet, so the vault's `default_action
 * = "Deny"` already admits it. It needed permission, not a network change.
 *
 * ## What this will not do
 *
 * **Return a secret's value, ever.** Not masked, not the last four characters,
 * not once. `secret-vault.js` has no read function and the app's custom vault
 * role has no `getSecret` action, so a future change that tries would get a 403
 * rather than a value. `admin-secrets.test.js` asserts the responses cannot
 * contain a seeded value even by accident.
 *
 * **Write a name Terraform does not reference.** `secret-catalog.js` is checked
 * against the `infra/` module in CI. A secret with no app setting pointing at it is
 * unreachable by application code, so seeding one creates a live credential
 * that nothing consumes and nobody owns.
 *
 * ## The four lights
 *
 * The owner asked for three — green, red, gray. The platform forces a fourth,
 * and leaving it out would make the page lie:
 *
 * - **gray / `never`** — `process.env` holds the literal `@Microsoft.KeyVault(…)`
 *   reference, or nothing. Never seeded, or the reference is not resolving.
 * - **amber / `pending`** — written AFTER this worker started. Environment
 *   variables are materialised at process start, so this worker's value cannot
 *   be the new one yet. Not a guess: a strict fact about when the write landed.
 * - **red / `failing`** — resolved to a real value, and the upstream service
 *   rejected it more recently than it accepted it. The one state
 *   `secrets-health.js` says it cannot see: "a setting whose reference resolves
 *   to the WRONG secret … only the upstream service can say it is wrong."
 * - **green / `live`** — resolved, and nothing has reported it broken.
 *
 * Amber clears when the worker answering the request started after the write.
 * On Flex Consumption workers recycle often, and the refresh call in
 * `secret-vault.js` makes the new value available to each new worker
 * immediately instead of on the 24-hour reference cache. Two workers can
 * therefore disagree for a few minutes, and the honest answer is the one the
 * answering worker can see.
