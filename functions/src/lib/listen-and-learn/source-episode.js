/**
 * One source-grounded Listen & Learn episode (#433): the payload rules, and
 * the run.
 *
 *   owner's URLs → validated list → dialogue (Gemini reads the sources) → MP3 → draft doc
 *
 * The sibling of `generate.js`, which runs a whole certification from its
 * study guide. This runs ONE episode from pages and videos the owner chose,
 * and it is a separate function rather than a branch of `generateEpisodes`
 * because almost nothing is shared: there is no guide to fetch, no areas to
 * loop over, no "watch next" videos to find, and no partial success to
 * preserve — one episode either lands as a draft or the run fails, and the
 * job carries the sentence saying why. What IS shared is imported from the
 * guide run rather than restated: `renderAudio` (a missing speech key
 * degrades, a broken one fails), `saveEpisode` (drafts only, whole-document
 * replace), `saveEpisodeFailure` (merge, keep the last good transcript).
 *
 * WHAT THE RUN WILL NOT DO. It will not write anything when the router
 * refuses the call — an invalid source list, Gemini absent from the provider
 * chain, the feature disabled in the portal. Those are refusals stated before
 * a byte is sent, and a failure marker for a run that never started would
 * read as a broken episode when the fix is configuration. Every other
 * failure — a source Gemini could not read, a model reply with no dialogue,
 * a rejected speech key — is recorded as a failed episode of kind `source`,
 * so the set shows the gap, and then rethrown so the job fails too.
 *
 * THE PAYLOAD IS VALIDATED TWICE, on purpose. `parseSourceEpisodePayload`
 * runs at the enqueue route (handlers.js `generateSourceEpisode`), so an
 * over-cap list or a YouTube URL given as a page is refused with the
 * sentence at once, as a 400 the form can show — not as a failed job the
 * page would have to poll for. The worker runs it again as the guard for any
 * other caller of the job type, and the router validates a third time before
 * spending. Same sentences each time, because they are the same function.
