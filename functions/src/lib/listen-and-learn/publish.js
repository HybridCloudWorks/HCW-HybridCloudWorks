/**
 * Persist generated Listen & Learn episodes.
 *
 * Episodes land as **drafts**. They are AI-written exam guidance published
 * under Saul's name on pages people study from, so nothing reaches the site
 * until it is approved in the admin portal. `status` is the only gate, and the
 * public read filters on it (public-reads.js `getListenAndLearn`).
 *
 * Layout
 *   Cosmos   listen_and_learn/{provider}_{examCode}              — the set (a book or course, ADR 0033 §4)
 *            listen_and_learn_episodes/{areaSlug} @ /setId       — one per area (a chapter)
 *            listen_and_learn_episodes/source_{slug} @ /setId    — one per source episode
 *            listen_and_learn_episodes/manual_{slug} @ /setId    — one per hand-made chapter
 *   Blob     listenandlearn/{provider}/{examCode}/{areaSlug}-{yyyymmddHHMMSS}.mp3
 *
 * AUDIO VERSIONS (ADR 0033 §4). Until 2026-10-03 regenerating an area wrote
 * the new MP3 to the SAME blob path, under a one-year immutable cache
 * header, so a listener who had heard the old take kept hearing it; and the
 * document was replaced wholesale, so a published episode went back to
 * draft, or — when the regeneration failed — off the site. Now every upload
 * carries a version stamp in its path, so regeneration never overwrites, and
 * a chapter carries `versions[]`, one entry per take, exactly one `active`.
 * The top-level `audioUrl` / `audioPath` / `audioBytes` / `durationSeconds` /
 * `speechProvider` / `speechModel` MIRROR the active version, so the public
 * readers and players need no change. A chapter written before versions
 * existed is read as one implicit version (`versionsOf`); its first
 * regeneration writes `versions[]` for real.
 *
 * Two containers rather than an `episodes[]` array on the set: episodes are
 * approved, regenerated and listened to individually, and concurrent array
 * updates on a single document lose writes. `listen_and_learn_episodes` is
 * partitioned on `/setId` precisely because an area slug is unique only within
 * its set — flattening these under `/id` would let AZ-104 and AZ-305 overwrite
 * each other's "manage-governance" episode (see cosmos-client PARTITION_KEY_PATHS).
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF EPISODE (#433). A guide-grounded episode is one scored area of
 * the official study guide; a source-grounded one is built from web pages and
 * YouTube videos the owner chose. Both live in the same container under the
 * same set, because both are Listen & Learn episodes of one certification,
 * and both are reviewed and approved the same way. What tells them apart is
 * `kind`, a STORED field — never inferred from whether `sources` happens to be
 * empty — read through `episodeKindOf`, which is the one place the rule "a
 * document with no `kind` is a guide episode" lives: every episode written
 * before #433 is a guide episode and carries no `kind`. The source list is
 * stored beside the transcript for the same reason the transcript is: a
 * reviewer who cannot see what the model was given is reviewing half of it.
 *
 * Ported from Site-Main `functions/listen-and-learn/publish.js` (088f458).
 * Firestore's `set({merge:true})` has no Cosmos equivalent — an upsert is a
 * whole-document replace — so the two merging writers read first and merge
 * explicitly. That is a round trip, and it is the reason the failure path
 * cannot quietly delete a good episode's transcript.
