/**
 * Turn a two-host dialogue into an episode MP3.
 *
 * Three providers, selected the way the AI router selects text models: a key
 * makes a provider POSSIBLE, and the first configured one in preference order
 * runs. Seed nothing and synthesis reports itself as not configured, which
 * generate.js treats as "publish the transcript, skip the audio" rather than as
 * a failed episode.
 *
 * Which providers, and in what order, depends on the PRODUCT asking (owner rule
 * 2026-09-09, ADR 0029 §2b). Until then one global order served every caller,
 * with ElevenLabs first because its key was present — so the paid podcast voice
 * read every Listen & Learn episode, and the `LISTEN_AND_LEARN_TTS_PROVIDER`
 * pin, read for every caller, would have pinned the podcast too. Every entry
 * point now takes `product` and refuses to guess without one:

 * A pin is an instruction, not a preference: it must name one of ITS product's
 * providers, and a pinned provider that is not configured FAILS rather than
 * falling through, because falling through would silently produce episodes in
 * a voice nobody chose. A pin naming a provider from the other product fails
 * with the rule above in the message. Nothing falls through between products
 * either: the podcast product with no ElevenLabs key is "not configured" — a
 * saved draft with `audioError` naming `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` — not a Gemini
 * reading. The out-of-credit fallthrough #447 added (ElevenLabs → Gemini) is
 * gone with it: its only use was the cross-product one this rule forbids.
 *
 * The Gemini model is a choice, not a fixed default: `synthesizeDialogue` and
 * `estimateSpeechCostUsd` take `model`, and the job resolves it per run →
 * stored setting → `LISTEN_AND_LEARN_TTS_MODEL` → the module default (see
 * ../speech-settings.js).
 *
 * All three return MP3, so everything downstream — the blob path, the stored
 * `contentType`, the `<audio>` element — is identical whichever ran. That is
 * deliberate: the provider is an implementation detail of this directory and
 * must not leak into the document shape.

 * table, so its estimate is honestly `null` rather than a guess.

 * the enqueue handler estimates against the script's byte ceiling before any
 * script exists. Two units are in play and they are kept apart, in the names
 * as well as the arithmetic: ElevenLabs bills CHARACTERS (code points), while
 * the speaking-rate constant borrowed from azure.js is UTF-8 BYTES per second.
 * A dialogue is therefore measured both ways and both counts are returned. A
 * ceiling is BYTES only: a byte count is never fewer than a character count,
 * so pricing ElevenLabs against it over-estimates, which is the direction a
