/**
 * Render a two-host dialogue to MP3 with Azure AI Speech — the fallback path.
 *
 * This is the one Listen & Learn module with no upstream ancestor. Site-Main
 * synthesised through Cloud Text-to-Speech with Application Default
 * Credentials — a GCP identity this Function App cannot hold, for the same
 * reason Vertex was dropped from the AI router (see ai/router.js). Azure
 * Speech is the Azure-native replacement and is a better fit besides:
 *
 *   - A dialogue is expressed directly. SSML permits many `voice` elements in
 *     one document, each naming a different voice, so alternating hosts are
 *     just alternating elements — no speaker-alias table, no `multiSpeakerMarkup`
 *     and no 4,000-byte-per-request text cap to script around.
 *   - Auth is a resource key in an app setting, resolvable from Key Vault like
 *     every other secret here, with nothing to federate.
 *
 * What replaces the byte cap is a DURATION cap, and it fails dangerously: the
 * REST API silently TRUNCATES output at ten minutes rather than erroring. A
 * dialogue is therefore chunked to a conservative audio budget and the MP3
 * parts are concatenated. Truncation would look like a complete episode that
 * simply stops talking, which is exactly the failure a reviewer would approve
 * without noticing.
 *
 * The key is optional. Without it this module throws `SpeechNotConfiguredError`,
 * which generate.js treats as "publish the transcript, skip the audio" rather
 * than as a failed episode — the feature ships before the key does.
 *
 * Endpoint, headers and output formats verified against the Text-to-speech
 * REST API reference on 2026-08-24.
 *
 * THIS IS THE FALLBACK, not the default — see speech/index.js. Gemini runs on a
 * key the site already holds; this needs a Cognitive Services resource, which
 * is a spend decision. It is kept written and tested because every Gemini TTS
 * model is a preview model, and a GA second path is what makes a model
 * retirement a config change rather than an outage.
