/**
 * Render a two-host dialogue to MP3 with ElevenLabs.
 *
 * Added when the owner approved a paid ElevenLabs plan on 2026-09-08 (ADR 0029
 * §2a, #436). It is the PODCAST voice — article and Plaud transcripts that go
 * to RSS.com — and only that (owner rule 2026-09-09, §2b): Listen & Learn is
 * read by Gemini TTS and never by this module, whatever keys are present.
 * The product switch in speech/index.js is what enforces that.
 *
 * **Started on the free plan (owner, 2026-09-26; §2a amended).** Before its
 * first dialogue request a render reads the account and refuses a job the
 * credits left cannot pay for in full, so a free month of 10,000 credits is
 * never half-spent on an episode that cannot finish. The result also carries
 * the plan the audio was rendered on, which is what the podcast's approval
 * step checks: free-plan audio has no commercial licence and is not published.
 * Both live in elevenlabs-account.js.
 *
 * Contract, verified against the Text to Dialogue API reference and capability
 * guide on 2026-09-08:
 *
 *   POST https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-dialogue?output_format=mp3_44100_64
 *   xi-api-key: <key>
 *   { model_id: 'eleven_v3', inputs: [{ text, voice_id }, …] }
 *
 * Four properties of that contract shape this module:
 *
 *   - **The dialogue is structured, not prompted.** Every turn is an
 *     `inputs[]` entry carrying its own `voice_id`, so alternating hosts are
 *     alternating entries — no speaker labels to keep in step with a voice
 *     table, as the Gemini path must. A turn whose speaker has no voice is
 *     therefore a hard error BEFORE any request is sent: there is nothing to
 *     put in `voice_id`, and the API would reject it after the bytes had been
 *     uploaded.
 *   - **The response is MP3.** `output_format` is a query parameter with a
 *     documented enum; `mp3_44100_64` is 64 kbps constant-bitrate mono, the
 *     bitrate mp3.js encodes the Gemini PCM to, so the stored bytes-per-second
 *     are the same whichever provider ran and mp3.js is bypassed entirely.
 *     (Only the 192 kbps MP3 and the 44.1 kHz PCM/WAV formats are tier-gated.)
 *   - **A request is capped at 2,000 characters.** The capability guide says to
 *     "keep the total length of all `inputs[].text` values at or below 2,000
 *     characters per request for reliable generation" and to concatenate the
 *     resulting audio, so a 9,000-byte episode is four or five requests.
 *     `chunkTurnsByCharacters` below measures CODE POINTS, the unit the
 *     ceiling is stated in and the unit the API bills. The Azure chunker
 *     measures UTF-8 bytes; borrowing it was safe but wasteful — a CJK script
 *     is three bytes a character and would have gone out in three times as
 *     many requests as it needed.
 *   - **Billing is per character**, USD 0.10 per 1,000 on the plans in
 *     question, and the API reports what it charged in a `character-cost`
 *     response header. That figure is preferred over our own count for the
 *     usage row: what was billed beats what was sent. On a plan's allowance
 *     the same figure is credits: Eleven v3 costs one credit per character
 *     (https://elevenlabs.io/pricing), which is what the pre-flight counts.
 *
 * ## How cost is recorded
 *
 * `ai_usage` rows carry `promptTokens` / `completionTokens` and are priced by
 * `getCostEstimate(provider, model, in, out)` against `COST_TABLE`, and the
 * admin usage page totals those columns client-side. Inventing a "characters"
 * column would need a second code path in the page and in `totalCostUsd`, and
 * every historical row would lack it. So a character IS the output unit here:
 * `completionTokens` is the billed character count, `promptTokens` is 0, and
 * `COST_TABLE.elevenlabs[model]` is expressed as USD per 1M characters (0.10
 * per 1,000 = 100 per 1M). `getCostEstimate` then prices the row without
 * knowing the unit changed, which is the whole point. The row is flagged
 * `estimatedTokens` only when the header was absent and the count is ours.
 *
 * ## Out of credit
 *
 * Two layers. The pre-flight above refuses a job the account cannot pay for,
 * before anything is sent. Behind it, a request that still meets an empty
 * account (a second render racing this one, or a key whose own credit limit
 * is tighter than the account's) is refused by the API: **401** with
 * `detail.status === 'quota_exceeded'` (ElevenLabs help centre, "API - Error
 * Code 400 or 401"), or **402** `insufficient_credits`
 * (https://elevenlabs.io/docs/eleven-api/resources/errors). Neither improves
 * on a retry, so neither is retried, and both carry `code: 'quota_exceeded'`
 * and the HTTP status. The pre-flight refusal carries the same code, with
 * `details.preflight` set. Nothing falls back to another provider on it: the
 * podcast has one provider (§2b), and generate.js records the sentence as
 * the draft's `audioError`.
 *
 * A 402 is not always about credit. ElevenLabs also answers 402
 * `paid_plan_required` when a free-plan key asks for a Voice Library voice
 * ("Free users cannot use library voices via the API",
 * https://elevenlabs.io/docs/overview/capabilities/voices). Reporting that as
 * "out of credit" would send the owner to top up an account that has
 * credits, so it is reported as its own code.
 *
 * ## Voices
 *
 * Two, one per host script.js writes (DEFAULT_SPEAKERS, Maya and Elena), and
 * **the owner chooses them** (#725). Precedence, highest first:
 *
 *   1. `voices`, which every podcast caller passes: the choice stored in
 *      `admin_config/podcast_voices` from the Audio tab's Podcast voices
 *      picker (podcast/voice-settings.js), read by podcast/generate.js for an
 *      episode and podcast/elevenlabs-admin.js for the live check;
 *   2. `ELEVENLABS_DEFAULT_VOICES`, which is **empty**.
 *
 * Empty on purpose. The first live check on the free plan, 2026-09-26, was
 * refused with 402 `paid_plan_required`: "Free users cannot use library
 * voices via the API". The defaults were Sarah (`EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL`), a
 * Default voice "only available for accounts that were created before March
 * 2026" and expiring 2026-12-31
 * (https://elevenlabs.io/docs/help-center/product/voices/my-voices/what-are-default-voices),
 * and Aria (`9BWtsMINqrJLrRacOk9x`), a Legacy voice the API routes to "Zoe"
 * (https://elevenlabs.io/docs/help-center/product/voices/my-voices/what-are-legacy-voices).
 * This account is newer, so to it both are library voices. The replacement
 * table on the Default voices page names new voices (Talia for Sarah, and so
 * on). It prints no ids, and its links open a Voice Library search, and
 * Voice Library voices "are not available via the API to free tier users"
 * (https://elevenlabs.io/docs/overview/capabilities/voices). Read on
 * 2026-09-26, the docs therefore name no id a free account made after March
 * 2026 is documented to be able to use. So there is no default to guess:
 * with nothing chosen a render stops before it sends anything, with
 * `code: 'voices_not_chosen'` and a sentence that says where to choose.
 *
 * `LISTEN_AND_LEARN_VOICE_MAYA` / `…_ELENA` are NOT read here any more. They
 * are Gemini's and Azure's, for Listen & Learn, and a Gemini voice name in
 * them was one step from being posted here as a `voice_id` (§2b, #725).
