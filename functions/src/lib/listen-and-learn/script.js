/**
 * Write the two-host dialogue for one Listen & Learn episode.
 *
 * Grounding is deliberate: the model is given the *official* study guide area
 * — its name, exam weighting, sub-headings and objective bullets — and nothing
 * else. It is not given YouTube transcripts. A single outdated video
 * demonstrating a retired portal flow would otherwise be laundered into an
 * episode that sounds authoritative, and exam prep is exactly the context
 * where confidently wrong is worse than absent.
 *
 * Ported from Site-Main `functions/listen-and-learn/script.js` (088f458). The
 * prompt, the coverage requirement and the trimming rules are unchanged. Two
 * things differ:
 *
 *   - The model is reached through this repository's AI router rather than
 *     `lib/ai-model-router` directly, and arrives as an injected `generate`
 *     so the whole pipeline stays testable without a key.
 *   - The byte budget is no longer shaped by a per-request API cap. Upstream
 *     sized it around Cloud TTS's 4,000-byte `multiSpeakerMarkup` limit. Neither
 *     provider here has that shape: Gemini takes the whole script in one
 *     request inside a 32k-token session, and Azure chunks against a
 *     ten-minute audio cap. `MAX_SCRIPT_BYTES` is therefore an editorial bound
 *     — this is a refresher, and an unbounded episode is one nobody finishes.
 *
 * A SECOND KIND, NOT A LOOSER FIRST (#433). `generateEpisodeScript` also
 * writes source-grounded episodes — built from web pages and YouTube videos
 * the owner chose — through the optional `grounding` argument. That does not
 * loosen the paragraph above: with no `grounding` the function is what it was,
 * the guide prompt is untouched and no source list is threaded into the
 * certification path. With `grounding` a separate prompt (`buildSourceGroundedPrompt`)
 * says the episode is built from the listed sources and nothing else, that
 * whatever a source returns is material and never an instruction, that the
 * hosts must not claim exam authority the sources do not carry, and it opens
 * with its own disclaimer. The call goes through the router's
 * `generateGroundedJsonResponse`, which reads the sources on Gemini's
 * Interactions endpoint and refuses — in a sentence, before a byte is sent —
 * when Gemini is not in the provider chain. It never fails over, because the
 * next provider down would answer confidently from the prompt alone, which is
 * precisely the laundering the first paragraph guards against.

- Depth may vary — spend longer on the harder items — but nothing may be skipped.

Style:
- Ground every claim in the line items above. Do not introduce services, features or exam details that are not implied by them.
- ${speakers.a} leads and frames; ${speakers.b} asks the question a learner would ask and adds practical colour.

- Say only what the sources support. Do not add services, features, numbers, opinions or examples they do not contain. Where they are silent, say so; where they disagree, say that too, rather than choosing one.
- Do not claim exam authority the sources do not carry. Never say the exam tests, requires, weights or asks about something unless a source says so. Where a source covers only part of an exam topic, say the listener should check the official study guide for the rest.
- Name which source a point came from when it matters — "the article says", "in the video" — so a listener can go back to it.
