/**
 * Add to a numeric field atomically, but only if the document still satisfies a

 *
 * This is the one primitive Cosmos offers that a read-modify-write cannot
 * emulate, and the reason it exists here is a counter that was wrong under
 * concurrency in the expensive direction: the submission quota read the count,
 * compared it, and wrote it back as three separate operations, so N simultaneous
 * requests all read the same value, all passed the limit check, and all wrote
 * `count: 1` — N accepted against a limit of five (TODO.md T-204).
 *
 * Both halves are needed and neither is sufficient alone:
 *
 *  - `incr` is applied server-side, so the increment cannot be lost. On its own
 *    it would still let every caller past the limit, because nobody checked.
 *  - `condition` is a SQL `FROM ... WHERE` predicate evaluated against the
 *    stored document in the same atomic operation as the patch. On its own it
 *    is just an ETag with extra steps.
 *
 * Together they are a compare-and-increment: writes to one document serialize
 * within its partition, so exactly the callers that observe a passing predicate
 * get their increment, and the rest get 412.
 *
 * **The predicate is a raw SQL fragment — there is no parameter binding for it
 * in the REST API or the SDK.** Never interpolate caller-controlled text into
 * it. `conditionValues` exists so the common case (numeric bounds) cannot be
 * written unsafely: values are checked as finite numbers and substituted for
 * `@name` placeholders, and anything else throws.
 *
 * **`incr` fails on a path that is absent or non-numeric** — "Node(PATH) isn't
 * a number", a 400, not a silent no-op. The documented "creates the field if it
 * doesn't exist" behaviour does not extend to a path holding a string. The
 * practical consequence is that a caller must make the predicate imply the
 * field is a number: a bound like `c.count < @limit` does this for free, since
 * a comparison against a missing or non-numeric property is undefined and
 * therefore does not match. Take that away and a malformed document turns into
 * a 400 on a hot path.
 *
 * Note also that the JS SDK's own documentation tab omits conditional patch —
 * only the .NET, Java and Python tabs show it. It does work: `PatchRequestBody`
 * is typed `{operations, condition?}` and `ClientContext.patch` forwards the
 * body verbatim to the REST API, whose documented shape is exactly that.
