 *   GET   /api/cms/newsletters/{id}          editor     one issue, rendered as it would send
 *   PATCH /api/cms/newsletters/{id}          editor     a draft's subject, preview text, note and sections
 *   POST  /api/cms/newsletters/{id}/intro    editor     regenerate a draft's AI intro
 *   POST  /api/cms/newsletters/{id}/subjects editor     AI subject-line suggestions (no write)

 *   DELETE /api/cms/newsletters/{id}         editor     delete a draft, rejected or failed issue
 *
 * Added for ADR 0033 (Amplify slice), so an approved issue can be managed
 * from here rather than from Resend's dashboard:
 *
 *   POST  /api/cms/newsletters/{id}/cancel     publisher  cancel a scheduled broadcast; the issue returns to Drafts
 *   POST  /api/cms/newsletters/{id}/reschedule publisher  move a scheduled broadcast to another time
 *   POST  /api/cms/newsletters/{id}/retry      publisher  a failed issue back to a draft for a fresh approval
 *   POST  /api/cms/newsletters/{id}/duplicate  editor     a new draft with this issue's content
 *   POST  /api/cms/newsletter-reconcile        editor     ask Resend where every scheduled issue stands
 *   GET   /api/cms/newsletter-sender           editor     the From address newsletters send from
 *   PUT   /api/cms/newsletter-sender           publisher  change it (validated on a Resend sending domain)
 *
 * ## Scheduled becomes sent by asking Resend (reconcile.js)
 *
 * Approval records `scheduled`; Resend does the sending and tells nobody. So
 * a read of a scheduled issue, a list that finds one overdue, and the
 * reconcile route each read `GET /broadcasts/{id}` and write what it says —
 * `sent` with Resend's `sent_at`, or `failed` with the reason when Resend
 * canceled or lost it. That is the only path to `sent` for a scheduled issue.
 *
 * ## Manual blocks (applySectionEdit, in section-edit.js since PR #841)
 *
 * The owner can add an item of their own — a chosen live article or a custom
 * block with a title, link, summary and image — to any section, or into a
 * section of their own (`manual`, `manual-<slug>`). A manual item carries
 * `manual: true` and is validated like a collected one: plain text, an https
 * link, an https image. Collected items are still never edited.
 *
 * The page's three tabs are views of one list: Review holds drafts not yet
 * saved (and rejected issues), Drafts holds saved drafts, and Published shows
 * scheduled and sent issues on a calendar, one month per `?month=YYYY-MM`
 * request. Deleting marks the issue `deleted` with an ETag-conditional write
 * rather than removing the document, so a delete can never race an approval
 * that has already claimed the issue; a deleted issue reads as not found.
 *
 * `approve` is routed in functions/src/functions/newsletter-admin-http.js and called by the
 * Mailing List page's Approve button. It is refused until the owner sets
 * newsletter_sending_enabled in Terraform.
 *
 * Approval is PUBLISHER, not editor: it emails every confirmed subscriber, which
 * is publishing in every sense the role exists for. It is also the owner's
 * decision of 2026-09-13 that nothing sends without it.
 *
 * ## An issue can be sent at most once, and only as the approver saw it
 *
 * Approval requires the `etag` of the issue the approver was looking at, so an
 * issue edited after they opened it is refused (409) rather than sent with
 * content they never read. It then CLAIMS the issue with an ETag-conditional
 * write from `draft` to `sending` before calling Resend, so two approvals racing
 * — a double click, two tabs, a retry — produce one broadcast; the loser gets a
 * 409. The outcome is written back only while the issue is still that claim, so
 * a reject that lands mid-send stands. A refused broadcast returns the issue to
 * `draft` with the reason; an accepted one makes it `scheduled` (or `sent`).
 *
 * An issue left in `sending` means a process died between the claim and
 * Resend's answer. It is never retried automatically, because a broadcast may
 * already exist; the answer says to check Resend's Broadcasts list, and reject is
 * allowed from `sending` so the owner can clear it once they have looked.
 *
 * ## Editing sections never adds content
 *
 * PATCH may drop items, reorder items within a section, reorder sections and
 * drop whole sections. It may not add an item, move one between sections or
 * change any field of one: titles and URLs come from the published site, and
 * the renderer re-checks every link. An item is identified by its section id
 * and its `url` (items carry no id of their own, and a section never lists
 * the same URL twice); the stored item is what is written back, so the page
 * only ever chooses which stored items remain and in what order.
 *
 * ## A test send cannot reach a subscriber
 *
 * `test` emails ONE address, the reply-to from Newsletter settings, through
 * Resend's single-email endpoint. It never reads an address from the request
 * and never touches a segment or a broadcast, which is why it works while
 * NEWSLETTER_SENDING_ENABLED is off.
 *
 * ## The design is the one that was previewed
 *
 * With a Resend template chosen in Newsletter settings (#557), the preview, the
 * test send and the broadcast are all laid out in it (template-layout.js),
 * from the same cached copy (template-source.js). When the template cannot be
 * fetched or used, the preview and the test send fall back to the built-in
 * design and say why in `templateProblem`. Approval does NOT fall back: it is
 * refused with 409 TEMPLATE_UNUSABLE before the claim, so an issue is never
 * broadcast in a design other than the one the owner chose and previewed.
