/**
 * confirmation-token.js — the signed link in a double opt-in email (ADR 0030).
 *
 * A subscriber is written to Resend only when they confirm, and ADR 0030 §4
 * keeps the list at Resend rather than mirrored in Cosmos. So the pending state
 * lives in the link itself: the address, where they signed up, and an expiry,
 * signed so nobody can mint a confirmation for an address they do not receive
 * mail at.
 *
 *   token = base64url(JSON { v, e, s, x }) + "." + base64url(HMAC-SHA256(key, payload))
 *
 * ## Why the key is derived from RESEND_API_KEY rather than a new secret
 *
 * A dedicated secret would be one more value for the owner to generate, one
 * more Key Vault reference and one more Terraform run before signup works. The
 * derivation costs none of that and gives up nothing:
 *
 *   - HKDF is one-way, so a leaked token or signature says nothing about the
 *     API key.
 *   - Whoever holds the Resend key can already add contacts to the list
 *     directly, so being able to forge a confirmation grants them nothing new.
 *   - Rotating the key invalidates links that are still pending, and a pending
 *     link lives for 48 hours. Someone mid-signup at the moment of a rotation
 *     signs up again, which is the right outcome for a key that was rotated
 *     because it may have leaked.
 *
 * ## Why the link carries the token in the fragment
 *
 * The email links to `/newsletter/confirm#t=<token>`. A fragment is never sent
 * to a server, so the address inside the token does not land in Cloudflare or
 * Static Web Apps request logs; the page reads it and POSTs it. The POST is also
 * what keeps a mail scanner that pre-fetches links from confirming on the
 * subscriber's behalf: fetching the page confirms nothing.
