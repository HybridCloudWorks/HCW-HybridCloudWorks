/**
 * issue.js — build this week's newsletter as a DRAFT (ADR 0030 §2a).
 *
 * Replaces `lib/content/digest.js`, which drafted a markdown article from
 * titles and summaries with no links into `newsletters`, where no code read
 * it; the `build-newsletter-issue` job runs this instead of
 * `generate-weekly-digest`. Its drafts carry no `kind`, so the admin surface,
 * which reads only `kind: 'weekly_issue'`, ignores them. An issue is
 * structured instead: the registered sections' items (each with the public URL
 * publishing stored), a short AI-written intro and subject, and a note the
 * owner can add. The email is rendered from that structure (render.js), so
 * editing the note never means editing HTML.
 *
 * Building never sends. An issue is created `draft`, and nothing in this module
 * reaches Resend: sending is a separate, approval-gated step (ADR 0029 §1b's
 * rule, kept by the owner on 2026-09-13).
 *
 * ## One issue per day, and an approved one is never rebuilt
 *
 * The id is the UTC date of the build, so pressing Build twice refreshes the
 * same draft (keeping the owner's note) instead of creating two drafts that
 * could both be approved. Once an issue is scheduled or sent, a rebuild on
 * that day is refused: the email readers get must be the one that was approved.
 *
 * ## Keeping a build in Drafts
 *
 * `build({ keep: true, keptBy })` stamps `savedAt`/`savedBy` on the issue it
 * writes, as the Save-to-Drafts button does, so the issue lands on the Drafts
 * tab instead of the Newsletter tab. The Monday timer uses it (#504). Keeping
 * changes where the draft is shown, never its status: it is still a `draft`,
 * and still needs the owner's approval to send. Every refusal above applies
 * unchanged, so a keep never overwrites a kept or approved issue.
 *
 * ## What goes in is the owner's choice (#557)
 *
 * Every build reads Newsletter settings → Content: only the sections turned
 * on, in the saved order, each capped at its saved item count; the saved
 * number of days back unless the caller names `days` (which is still clamped);
 * and the AI intro only when it is on, in the saved tone. The Build button and
 * the Monday timer both pass no `days`, so both follow the saved window.
