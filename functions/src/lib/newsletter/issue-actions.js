/**
 * issue-actions.js — cancel, reschedule and retry an approved issue (ADR 0033
 * Amplify slice; split out of admin-handlers.js for PR #841).
 *
 *   POST /api/cms/newsletters/{id}/cancel     publisher  cancel a scheduled broadcast; the issue returns to Drafts
 *   POST /api/cms/newsletters/{id}/reschedule publisher  move a scheduled broadcast to another time
 *   POST /api/cms/newsletters/{id}/retry      publisher  a failed issue back to a draft for a fresh approval
 *
 * The three share one shape — the role, the etag, the issue as stored, a
 * status it must be in, the caller's view still current — and differ only in
 * what they do once all of that holds. `issueAction` is that shape, and each
 * route hands it the differences. The document transitions at the bottom are
 * pure: the stored issue in, the issue to write out, with `at` the ISO
 * instant of the action. Cancel and a reschedule that Resend refused both
 * release the broadcast the same way, so the shared fields live in one place
 * and the two can only differ in `lastError`.
 *
 * `createIssueActions(deps)` takes the admin factory's own readers and
 * presenters so an issue is read, rendered and shown exactly as the other
 * routes do it; nothing here reads a document the admin routes do not.
