/**
 * reconcile.js — move an approved issue to where Resend says it is (ADR 0033
 * Amplify slice).
 *
 * Approval writes `scheduled` and a `broadcastId`, and until 2026-10-03
 * nothing ever wrote `sent`: only a send-now approval stamped `sentAt`, so a
 * scheduled issue stayed `scheduled` forever, its metrics never appeared and
 * the calendar showed a send that had long gone out. This reads
 * `GET /broadcasts/{id}` and writes what it finds:
 *
 *   sent        → status `sent`, `sentAt` from Resend (or now)
 *   scheduled   → `scheduledAt` refreshed from Resend when it moved
 *   queued      → still scheduled; `broadcastStatus: 'queued'` so the page can say so
 *   canceled    → status `failed`, `lastError` says Resend canceled it
 *   HTTP 404    → status `failed`, `lastError` says Resend no longer has it
 *   anything else (5xx, no answer) → no write; the reason is returned
 *
 * Every write is ETag-conditional on the issue as read, so a reconcile that
 * races a reschedule or a cancel loses quietly and the next read tries again.
 * It is run lazily — on the list for overdue scheduled issues, on a read of a
 * scheduled issue, and on demand from the hub — rather than by a timer: the
 * timer catalogue is Terraform-owned, and a read that fixes itself needs no
 * schedule.
