/**
 * The scheduled pricing refresh — the writer of `tool_service_cache` (#613).
 *
 * This is the job the freshness RCA in freshness.js was waiting for: that
 * module reports staleness and explicitly refuses to refresh on the request
 * path, so something has to. This is it. One document per region option, the
 * whole catalog in each, rewritten wholesale every run: the document is the
 * unit of freshness, so a half-updated document is not a state that exists.
 *
 * Two shapes of caution, both deliberate:
 *
 *   - **Services are fetched one at a time**, not fanned out. Each
 *     `fetchLivePricing` call already runs its three providers in parallel;
 *     three regions by eight services on top of that is 72 concurrent calls
 *     against two APIs that rate-limit (AWS GetProducts, Azure Retail
 *     Prices) and one that pages 5,000 SKUs at a time. Sequential is slower
 *     by a minute and never throttled. The job's timeout is sized for it.
 *   - **A region failing does not stop the others.** The failure is logged,
 *     recorded in the summary, and the loop continues, so an Azure outage in
 *     one region cannot leave every region's document a day older than it
 *     needs to be. Inside a region the library already isolates providers;
 *     this is the same rule one level up.
 *
 * The baseline handed to the library is `fallbackBaselineFor`, not
 * `baselineFor`: the two unit-mismatched services get null and a live miss
 * for them is an absent row (owner decision 2026-09-15, baseline.js header).
 *
 * After the cache document, and only after it, each region also gets a
 * history snapshot and a price-change document (history.js, #613 Phase 3).
 * Those are second-class on purpose: a failure there is logged and recorded
 * in `summary.failed` as `history: …`, and the region still counts as
 * refreshed, because the page's prices were already written and a feed of
 * changes is not worth a day of stale prices.
