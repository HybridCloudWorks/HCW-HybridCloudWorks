/**
 * pulse.js — `healthPulse`, every five minutes: the Health Hub checking the
 * platform while nobody is looking (#1010).
 *
 * Before this the hub only knew what someone had asked it in a browser, so a
 * dependency that broke at night was "not tested yet" until morning, and
 * nothing said whether the checks themselves were still running. The pulse
 * runs every check the backend can make on its own (pulse-checks.js), records
 * each result in the same store a browser's Test writes to
 * (probe-results.js) with `checkedBy: 'pulse'`, and then records its own
 * heartbeat. The page reads both: every card says when it was last checked
 * and by whom, and the hub says "Pulse: every 5 min, last 3 min ago" — or
 * that the pulse is late, which is itself the most important finding.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHECKS. One ops snapshot (the same `buildSnapshot` the Overview
 * reads) answers Cosmos, runtime configuration, unresolved Key Vault
 * references, storage, scheduled publishing, publishing failures, review
 * queue age, orphaned images, live-page links, the forge and Telegram
 * notices. Three point queries answer the lab agents' heartbeats, the AI
 * providers' last recorded tests and the MCP servers' last syncs.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT. It calls no third party and spends nothing: the service
 * tests (Publer, Resend, the models) stay on their Test buttons, and the AI
 * providers are judged by what their last Test recorded, not by a new prompt.
 *
 * FAILURE. A check that throws is a result for its probe when the cause is
 * the dependency (the snapshot failing is Cosmos's verdict), and otherwise is
 * left unrecorded and listed on the heartbeat, so a bug in one check never
 * writes a false verdict. If Cosmos itself cannot be written, the heartbeat
 * cannot be either: the run throws, the host records the failure, and the
 * page sees the pulse go late — which is the honest outcome.
