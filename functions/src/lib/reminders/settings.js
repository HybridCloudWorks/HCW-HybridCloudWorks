/**
 * reminders/settings.js — the owner's dated reminders: the shape, its
 * normalizer, and when each one is due to be said.
 *
 * Owner request 2026-10-06, after a token expiry and a re-verification date
 * had been living in session notes and memory files rather than anywhere the
 * platform could act on: "reminders should leverage Telegram as well", kept
 * on a sheet of their own under Platform Settings. One `admin_config`
 * document holds them (`admin_config/reminders`, edited on Platform Settings
 * → Reminders through cms/platform-settings/reminders), and the daily
 * `sendReminders` timer (timers/reminders.js) reads it and tells the owner on
 * Telegram ahead of each date, on the day, and weekly after it until the
 * reminder is marked done.
 *
 * The shape is exactly what the timer reads, normalized on every save the
 * same way every other platform setting is (platform-settings.js): unknown
 * keys are refused, dates must be real calendar dates, and the `notified`
 * stamps the timer writes round-trip through the page unchanged, so a save
 * from the sheet never makes a reminder fire twice.

 * carry only what they sent. Review of #910: without this, a save made after
 * the 13:00 run erased that morning's stamp and the reminder was said again.
 *
 * THE CREDENTIAL REGISTER'S ROWS ARE NOT THE SHEET'S TO CHANGE (review of
 * #1039). This page saves at `editor`, below the `super_admin` that records
 * a rotation, so a save that could mark a `credential-` row done, re-date
 * it, or remove it would let an editor silence a renewal warning. A save
 * therefore carries every stored register row through exactly as stored,
 * stamps included, and drops any register row the request sent, new or
 * changed: it cannot add, remove or alter one. Their stamps are the stored
 * ones, not a merge with the request's, because the stored row already
 * holds every stamp the timer wrote (what the merge above exists to keep),
 * and a request's stamp could otherwise be a forged one that silences a
 * stage. Recording a rotation on Integrations → Credentials is the only way
 * a register row's cycle ends. The owner's own rows behave exactly as
 * before.
 *
 * Editors can still READ the register rows, and so the credential names in
 * their titles and notes. That is accepted: those names (secret names,
 * variable names, file paths) are public in this repository's own docs,
 * docs/standards/required-inputs.md among them; the rows carry no value.
 *
 * Throws RemindersValidationError when the owner's rows and the stored
 * register rows together pass MAX_REMINDERS.
