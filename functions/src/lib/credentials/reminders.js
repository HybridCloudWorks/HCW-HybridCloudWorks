/**
 * Reminders for the credentials only the owner can renew (#1026), through the
 * existing Reminders feature: the same document (admin_config/reminders), the
 * same daily `sendReminders` timer (SEND_REMINDERS) and the same Telegram
 * notifier. Nothing here sends anything; it keeps rows on the sheet, and the
 * timer says them.
 *
 * ## Which credentials, and which reminder
 *
 * Every `hand` credential with a rotation rule (`lifetimeDays`). Today that
 * is the issue's list: the Anthropic key, the Telegram bot token, the two
 * GitHub App private keys, the Coder GitHub OAuth secret, the Static Web
 * Apps deployment token's 90-day reset and the two 730-day lab host
 * certificates. Each has a reminder, always (#1026 asks for one for each),
 * and which one depends on whether a date is known:
 *
 *   ROTATE   a date is known (a Key Vault write, or one the owner recorded):
 *            "Rotate <name>", due on the computed due date, said first when
 *            its row turns amber on the tab (lead days = its due-soon window).
 *   RECORD   no date yet: "Record when <name> was last rotated", due the day
 *            it was first added, with no lead days. A due date for the
 *            rotation made up from nothing would fire on the wrong day, so
 *            this one asks for the date instead. Its due date STAYS the day
 *            it was first added (found on the sheet by its title) rather
 *            than moving to each day's sync, which would reset it daily.
 *
 * Recording the date, or a Key Vault write the sync sees, turns the RECORD
 * row into the ROTATE row at the real due date: a date move, so the rule
 * below starts it fresh.
 *
 * ## The rows: register-managed, by a reserved id
 *
 * A credential's reminder is the row `credential-<register id>`. The register
 * owns that row whole (title, due date, lead days, notes, link, and `done`,
 * which it never sets) and nothing else on the sheet: every other row is the
 * owner's and is passed through untouched, in its place. A `credential-` row
 * whose credential no longer has a rule is removed; a new one is appended.
 *
 * ONE FIELD IS KEPT while the cycle stands (the same due date and title):
 * `notified`, the timer's stamps, so a sync never makes a stage fire twice.
 * `done` is NOT kept: a register row is always open, and one found marked
 * done is reopened (review of #1039). The sheet saves at `editor`, below
 * the `super_admin` that records a rotation, and its save no longer changes
 * these rows at all (reminders/settings.js mergeStoredStamps); this is the
 * second half, for a `done` that reached the document some other way.
 * Recording the rotation is the only way a register row's cycle ends. When
 * the due date or the title moves (a rotation was recorded, or the Keys tab
 * wrote a new value), the row starts fresh with no stamps: it is a new
 * cycle, and the old cycle's stamps would otherwise keep its "coming up" and
 * "due" messages from ever being said.
 *
 * ## When it runs
 *
 *   - when a rotation is recorded on the Credentials tab (handlers.js);
 *   - when the owner presses Update reminders there;
 *   - at the start of every `sendReminders` run, before anything is said, so
 *     a Keys-tab rotation since the last run has already moved its row and
 *     no message is built from a stale date.
 *
 * ## Sharing the document
 *
 * Three writers now share admin_config/reminders: the sheet's save (a full
 * replace that keeps the timer's stamps, platform-settings.js), the timer's
 * stamps (ETag, re-read on 412), and this. This writes only when the merged
 * rows differ from the stored ones, under the document's ETag, so an owner's
 * edit is never lost to a sync and a sync is never lost to a stamp. The one
 * race it cannot win is the sheet saving a copy loaded before a sync: that
 * save puts the old credential rows back, and the next sync moves them
 * again. Because the timer syncs before it says anything, the message is
 * never the stale one.
 *
 * EVERY ATTEMPT RE-READS EVERYTHING, the sheet first and the date sources
 * after it (sources.js), and computes the rows from that read (review of
 * #1039: a snapshot taken once before the retries let a rotation recorded
 * mid-sync be overwritten by its old due date). The order is what makes the
 * write safe: a rotation recorded after this attempt read the sheet is
 * followed by its own sync (handlers.js), which reads its dates after the
 * record and writes the sheet under an ETag; whichever of the two writes
 * second finds the ETag changed and goes round again with fresh dates, so
 * the last write is always computed from the newest record.
 *
 * A sheet that does not validate is left alone: the owner repairs it on
 * Platform Settings, and the sync tries again next time. So is one the
 * credential rows would push past MAX_REMINDERS.
 *
 * Telemetry carries counts only, the timer's rule.
