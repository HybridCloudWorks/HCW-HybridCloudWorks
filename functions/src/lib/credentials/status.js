/**
 * How old each credential is, when it expires, and whether that is a problem
 * (#1026). Pure: every function here takes the sources it reads and the
 * clock, so each state is testable without Cosmos and without a calendar.
 *
 * ## The four states
 *
 *   ok        nothing is due: it renews itself, it is an identifier, its
 *             expiry is outside its window, or no rule makes it due
 *   due-soon  its expiry or rotation date is inside its window (DUE_SOON_DAYS,
 *             or SHORT_DUE_SOON_DAYS for a short-lived one)
 *   overdue   past it, or signed out: shown red
 *   unknown   a rule exists but the date it runs from does not: no rotation
 *             recorded, no report from its automation, or a source that
 *             could not be read
 *
 * ## Where an expiry comes from
 *
 * A LIVE expiry first: what the lab host reported for a Coder token. Failing
 * that, for a HAND credential only, the last rotation plus its lifetimeDays,
 * marked `expiryEstimated`. An automation-renewed credential is judged only
 * by what its automation reports, never by an estimate: the Coder status
 * token the owner minted by hand on 2026-09-28 lasts a year, and an estimate
 * from the 90-day tokens the lab host mints would have shown it overdue for
 * nine months it was valid. Without a report it is `unknown`, which is true.
 *
 * ## Where the last rotation comes from
 *
 * The latest of: the Keys tab's `lastWriteAt` for a Key Vault secret
 * (admin_config/secret_state), the lab host's `statusTokenRotatedAt`, an
 * OAuth connection's refresh or connect time, and the date the owner
 * recorded on the tab (admin_config/credential_register). The owner's date
 * counts only for a hand-renewed credential, which is the only kind the tab
 * lets them record.
 *
 * ## A source that could not be read
 *
 * A credential whose dates come from a source sources.js could not read, or
 * read and found malformed, is `unknown`, with no age, expiry or reminder:
 * a status computed from the sources that DID answer would be a guess
 * presented as a fact (review of #1039: an owner-recorded date standing in
 * for a Key Vault write nobody could see).
 *
 * NOTHING HERE TOUCHES A VALUE. An mcp_servers record holds its tokens, so
 * it reaches this module only as the projection sources.js asks Cosmos for:
 * dates, states and a `hasToken` boolean. Every other source is read by the
 * one field it is wanted for.
