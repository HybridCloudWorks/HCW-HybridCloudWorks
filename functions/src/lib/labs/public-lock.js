/**
 * The lock on the public lab submission: "Validate on the lab" is taken only
 * from the Landing Zone Builder's pane on the site.
 *
 * Owner decision 2026-09-28, recorded as the amendment to ADR 0032 decision
 * 6: "The lab should only be accessible through 'panes' from my site, lock to
 * that." Two proofs, both checked before anything reads the store or moves a
 * counter (the order is public-submit.js's), and neither widens a bound:
 *
 *   1. THE ORIGIN. The request's `Origin` must be exactly one of the site's
 *      own, `PRODUCTION_ORIGINS` in auth/cors.js: the apex and www, both of
 *      which serve the site. Not the Static Web App's preview hostname (a
 *      break-glass path, not the pane), not `EXTRA_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, not
 *      localhost. A missing Origin is refused too. That is the reverse of
 *      cors.js, which lets a missing Origin through because CORS is not an
 *      authorization control; here the Origin IS the claim being checked.
 *      On its own it stops only browsers on other sites: curl can send any
 *      header. Hence the second proof.
 *
 *   2. A CLOUDFLARE TURNSTILE TOKEN. The widget on the builder's pane issues
 *      a token for the action `lab-validate`, and the body carries it as
 *      `turnstileToken`. This module sends it to Cloudflare's siteverify with
 *      the secret key and the caller's address, and accepts only
 *      `success: true` for one of the site's hostnames and exactly that
 *      action. Tokens are single use and live five minutes, so a replayed
 *      one fails at siteverify (`timeout-or-duplicate`) and a token minted
 *      for another action or on another site is refused here.
 *
 * A FLOOD OF JUNK TOKENS IS DAMPED BEFORE CLOUDFLARE IS ASKED. The per-client
 * quota needs the store, so it sits after the lock; before siteverify, an
 * in-memory limiter per Function App instance (`createCheckLimiter`) allows
 * one client key ten checks in ten minutes and answers the eleventh 429
 * TURNSTILE_RATE_LIMITED, still without a store read.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED. No secret (unset, or a Key Vault reference the platform did
 * not resolve, which `resolvedSetting` reads as unset) closes the door for
 * everyone, before the body is read: the status read and the POST both say
 * TURNSTILE_NOT_CONFIGURED. Siteverify unreachable, slow past five seconds,
 * answering non-2xx or non-JSON, or refusing the secret itself, is 503
 * TURNSTILE_UNAVAILABLE: never a pass. A token Cloudflare rejects, or one
 * whose hostname or action is not ours, is 403 TURNSTILE_FAILED.
 *
 * WHAT GOES TO CLOUDFLARE, AND WHAT IS LOGGED. Siteverify receives the
 * secret, the token and `remoteip`, the address auth/client-identity.js
 * trusts (`trustedClientIp`: `CF-Connecting-IP`, and only on a request that
 * carried the origin secret; omitted otherwise, since the field is
 * optional). A refusal logs why, with Cloudflare's error codes, the hostname
 * and the action it reported, and never the token, the address or the
 * secret.
 *
 * THE WIDGET IS NOT TERRAFORM'S. The pinned cloudflare provider (5.25) has
 * `cloudflare_turnstile_widget`, and its `secret` is a read-only attribute,
 * so managing the widget would put this secret in HCP Terraform state, which
 * docs/standards/variables-and-secrets.md forbids. The owner creates the
 * widget in the Cloudflare dashboard, the site key reaches the build as the
 * repository variable VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY (public by construction), and
 * the secret goes into Key Vault as TURNSTILE-SECRET-KEY through the API-keys
 * page. `infra/frontend.tf` records the same reasoning where a reader of the
 * Cloudflare resources would look for it.
