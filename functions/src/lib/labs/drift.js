/**
 * drift.js — whether the lab host runs main (#1009; the drift half of LAB-4,
 * #950).
 *
 * On 2026-10-08 the host was six merged pull requests behind main, the docs
 * said LAB-5 was live, and nothing anywhere said otherwise: bootstrap.sh is
 * re-run by hand after a merge, and nobody had. This module makes that lag a
 * signal. It does not heal it: nothing here runs the playbook, and nothing
 * should, because a merge that changes sshd or the Docker daemon is applied
 * by the owner, watching.
 *
 * THREE PIECES, AND WHERE EACH COMES FROM
 *
 *   applied   The commit the host last converged from. site.yml's last task
 *             writes /etc/hcw/applied-commit.json (only after every role and
 *             check passed), the agent sends it on every heartbeat
 *             (vps-agent/lib/applied-commit.js), and lib/lab-agent.js stores
 *             it on the agent's registry document as `applied`.
 *   main      The commits on main that touch what the host runs: lab-host/
 *             (the playbook and the Coder template) and vps-agent/ (the agent
 *             runs from a checkout of the same commit). Read here from
 *             GitHub's public REST API, once an hour, by checkAgentHealth
 *             (lib/timers/agent-health.js), into admin_config/lab_drift.
 *   verdict   labDriftVerdict below, pure: the health pulse records it as the
 *             `lab-drift` probe every five minutes, and getLabsSnapshot puts
 *             it on each agent's card.
 *
 * WHY THE PUBLIC GITHUB API, AND NOT THE SITE'S OWN BUILD COMMIT. The
 * Functions app is deployed by hand (deploy-functions.yml is dispatch-only),
 * so the commit it was built from says nothing about main: a host that lags
 * main by a week can be ahead of a site deployed a fortnight ago. The
 * repository is public, so the read needs no token and adds no secret; the
 * Drafts import already reads the same API the same way, through the same
 * pinned, redirect-refusing, size-capped fetch (cms/repo-draft-source.js),
 * which this reuses rather than copies. The call is server-side, so the SPA's
 * Content-Security-Policy is not involved, and the Function App's egress is
 * open to the Internet (infra/network.tf). The unauthenticated limit is 60
 * requests an hour per outbound address; this spends two an hour, and a
 * refusal (`RATE_LIMITED`) is recorded and shown, never guessed past.
 *
 * WHY ONLY THOSE TWO PATHS. A docs or frontend merge changes nothing on the
 * host, and counting it would have the owner re-run the playbook daily for
 * nothing, which is how an alarm comes to be ignored. The squash-merged main
 * is linear, so "merged after the applied commit" is "committed after it":
 * the comparison is by committer date, against the applied commit's own
 * committer date, which the host reports beside its sha.
 *
 * THE RULE. A host is behind when a commit under lab-host/ or vps-agent/
 * merged after its applied commit, and the oldest such commit merged more
 * than DRIFT_LAG_LIMIT_MS (24 h) ago: a day is the owner's window to re-run
 * bootstrap.sh after a merge. A host that has never reported a commit is
 * behind by definition: it has not completed a run since this check exists.
