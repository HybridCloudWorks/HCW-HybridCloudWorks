/**
 * The lab agent registry's write path (#740): `POST cms/labs/agents`,
 * `PATCH cms/labs/agents/{agentId}` and `DELETE cms/labs/agents/{agentId}`.
 * What they accept, and the document they write, are
 * agent-registry-rules.js; this file applies them.
 *
 * The agent guard's second gate (auth/require-agent.js) admits a lab agent
 * only when `lab_agents/{agentId}` names it, and until this module nothing
 * could write that container: no route, a read-only Labs page, and a Cosmos
 * firewall that admits only the Function App's subnet. So the agent
 * authenticated and was refused with "Agent access required", and
 * scripts/lab/Register-LabAgent.ps1 could only print the document it needed.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE DOCUMENT, AS ITS READERS READ IT
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 *   id            the agent id. lab_agents is partitioned on /id, and every
 *                 reader point-reads it as (agentId, agentId):
 *                 default-agent-guard.js, lab-agent.js's heartbeat patch
 *   agentId       the same value (infra/main.tf's partition-key rationale);
 *                 timers/agent-health.js reads `agentId || id`
 *   oid           the agent service principal's object id, which is the `oid`
 *                 claim of its app-only token. require-agent.js compares it
 *                 with `!==`, and Entra writes that claim in lower case, so it
 *                 is stored lower-cased: an upper-case paste would otherwise
 *                 be an oid-mismatch that looks exactly like a missing grant
 *   active        `true` or `false`, never anything else: the guard admits
 *                 only `active === true`
 *   capabilities  the job types the agent may claim. The claim path reads it
 *                 from here and never from the request (lab-agent.js), and
 *                 public-submit.js reads it to decide whether anything online
 *                 can run a public job. Validated against LAB_JOB_TYPES and
 *                 stored in that table's order, so a re-registration with the
 *                 same set in another order is not a change
 *   registeredAt, updatedAt, updatedBy
 *                 when, and which admin's object id. Identifiers, not secrets
 *
 * The heartbeat's fields (hostname, version, status, activeJobs, lastSeenAt)
 * live in the same document and are never written here: an existing document
 * is PATCHED with the registry fields only, so a registration never rewinds a
 * heartbeat that landed in between. Nothing secret is stored, because nothing
 * secret is accepted: the body is exactly { agentId, oid, jobTypes? } and any
 * other key is a 400.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * WHO MAY WRITE IT
 * ===========================================================================
 * `editor`, the role the other Labs writes require (enqueueLabJob,
 * cancelLabJob). That is enough because this is gate 2 of two, not the whole
 * grant. Gate 1 is the LabAgent app role, which only a tenant administrator
 * can assign (Register-LabAgent.ps1 does it as the owner), so a registry row
 * can bind an agent id only to a principal the tenant already trusts as an
 * agent; it can never mint an agent credential. What an editor can do here,
 * rebind or deactivate an agent, is audited like every other admin mutation.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * IDEMPOTENT, AND A REVOCATION STAYS REVOKED
 * ===========================================================================
 * POST creates the document active, or updates `oid` and `capabilities` on
 * one that exists. It does NOT reactivate a deactivated agent: re-running the
 * go-live, or pasting the same values again, must not quietly undo a
 * revocation. Only `PATCH { active: true }` does that, so turning an agent
 * back on is always its own audited act. A POST that changes nothing writes
 * nothing, document or audit row, and answers `changed: false`.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * REMOVING ONE (owner request 2026-09-28)
 * ===========================================================================
 * A host rebuild can leave the old agent id behind: the VPS reinstalled on
 * 2026-09-26 came back as vps-hostinger-01, and srv939861's record stayed on
 * the Agents tab, offline and deactivated, with no way to take it off. DELETE
 * deletes the document, and refuses two cases first:
 *
 *   - an ACTIVE agent (409, "Deactivate it first"). The guard admits it, so
 *     deleting it would revoke it without the audited deactivation, and the
 *     page offers Remove only on a deactivated card anyway.
 *   - an agent that still HOLDS a job (409): a `running` one, or a `claimed`
 *     one inside lab-agent.js's CLAIM_LEASE_MS. That is how jobs reference an
 *     agent, `lab_jobs.agentId`, written by the claim. A claim older than the
 *     lease is not held: the claim path hands it to the next agent that polls
 *     for its type, and a deactivated agent could never report it anyway
 *     (the guard refuses its completeLabJob). Counting it would let one
 *     stranded job block the removal forever, with nothing on the page able
 *     to clear it, since cancelLabJob cancels only queued jobs.
 *
 * The deletion is audited as `lab_agent_removed` with the removed document's
 * agentId, oid, lastSeenAt and version, because the row is then the only
 * record the agent existed. A second DELETE answers 404, the same answer as
 * PATCH on an unknown id. Nothing about the host changes: its certificate and
 * app registration stay, and without a document gate 2 refuses it, which is
 * the state before its first registration. Register agent adds it back.
 *
 * Between the read and the delete another editor could activate the agent.
 * That race only ever errs towards revocation, since a deleted agent is
 * refused, and a registration restores it; so the delete is not ETag-guarded.
 *
 * The handlers are module-scope functions over one `deps` object and the
 * factory only wires them, the shape public-submit.js uses: written as
 * closures inside the factory, every branch of every handler counted into the
 * factory's own complexity.
