/**
 * Anonymous lab submission (#672, Phase 6 of #657): the Landing Zone
 * Builder's "Validate on the lab".
 *
 *   GET  /api/public/labs/submit        whether a submission would be taken now
 *   POST /api/public/labs/submit        queue one terraform-validate job
 *   GET  /api/public/labs/job?jobId=    that job's status and output
 *
 * Four modules: the contract (public-bounds.js: the switch, the bounds, the
 * door codes, the body's checks, the job document), the lock to the site's
 * pane (public-lock.js: the origin and the Turnstile token), the job read
 * (public-job.js), and this one, which carries the door and the submission
 * pipeline and wires all three routes. Everything a caller or a test needs
 * is re-exported here.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * OPEN BY THE OWNER'S DECISION, AND ONLY FROM THE SITE'S PANE.
 * ===========================================================================
 * ADR 0032 decision 6 held this path Gated until the owner revised it, which
 * the owner did on 2026-09-28: open, locked to the Landing Zone Builder's
 * pane on the site by its origin and a Cloudflare Turnstile token
 * (public-lock.js), with every bound below unchanged. Three things must all
 * hold before a job is taken, and each fails closed:
 *
 *   LABS_PUBLIC_SUBMISSION_ENABLED = "true"   (infra: labs_public_submission_enabled)
 *   TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY resolves             (Key Vault TURNSTILE-SECRET-KEY)
 *   an agent registered for the type is heartbeating
 *
 * The switch is exact: anything but "true" is closed ("false", "TRUE", "1",
 * absent). While it is off, every one of the three routes answers
 * `PUBLIC_SUBMISSION_CLOSED` before it reads the body, the caller's identity
 * or the store, so a closed path can never touch the queue. The same rule as
 * NEWSLETTER_SENDING_ENABLED in lib/newsletter/admin-handlers.js, and setting
 * the Terraform variable to false is the one-step kill switch. With the
 * switch on and no Turnstile secret, the submission and the status read
 * answer `TURNSTILE_NOT_CONFIGURED`, again before any read.
 *
 * THE LOCK COMES BEFORE ANY STORE READ OR COUNTER. A POST whose `Origin` is
 * not exactly the site's is 403 ORIGIN_NOT_ALLOWED before its body is read;
 * one without a Turnstile token is 403 TURNSTILE_REQUIRED; a client past ten
 * checks in ten minutes on this instance is 429 TURNSTILE_RATE_LIMITED; one
 * Cloudflare's siteverify does not pass for the site's hostname and the
 * `lab-validate` action is 403 TURNSTILE_FAILED; and siteverify out of reach
 * is 503 TURNSTILE_UNAVAILABLE. All five happen before the lab is read, so a
 * refused request costs the store nothing and spends no one's quota.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE BOUNDS ARE DECISION 6's, AND NO WIDER. Each one is a test.
 * ===========================================================================
 *   - Only `terraform-validate`: a body naming any other type is 400.
 *   - A 64 KB payload, measured on the encoded string, the same cap as the
 *     admin enqueue (LAB_JOB_TYPES in lib/labs.js); larger is 413. A
 *     `Content-Length` over the envelope's cap is refused before the body is
 *     read at all.
 *   - 2 submissions an hour per client, through `enforceSubmissionQuota` on
 *     the Cloudflare-verified hashed identity every anonymous route uses
 *     (auth/client-identity.js; `lab-caller:<hash>` in submission_quota); the
 *     third is 429. The window is the helper's: it opens at a client's first
 *     submission and resets an hour later, as it does for every anonymous
 *     route.
 *   - 50 a day globally, a counter `lab-public-quota:<day>` in
 *     tool_service_cache taken with a compare-and-increment (lib/daily-cap.js,
 *     the explain route's counter); the fifty-first is 503 until tomorrow, UTC.
 *   - Refused outright while more than 20 jobs are queued: 503 LAB_QUEUE_FULL.
 *   - Written with `public: true` and a one-day `ttl`.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED WHILE NO AGENT IS ONLINE. A job is queued only when a lab
 * agent registered for `terraform-validate` has heartbeated within the
 * admin snapshot's window (`isAgentOnline`, lib/labs.js), so a submission
 * never waits in a queue nobody drains. No agent is 503 LAB_AGENT_OFFLINE; a
 * failed read of the agents or the queue is 503 LAB_STATUS_UNAVAILABLE,
 * never "open".
 *
 * ORDER. Switch, Turnstile configured, origin, body, identity, the Turnstile
 * token, lab, then the two counters, then the write. The first two are the
 * door for everyone and read only settings; the origin reads one header; the
 * token is checked after the identity because siteverify is given the
 * address the identity trusts. The lab check comes before the counters so a
 * visitor is never charged for a job the lab could not have run, the same
 * reason the explain route checks its provider before counting. The lab
 * check reads the status route's one-minute door first: a shut door there
 * refuses without reading the lab, so anonymous POSTs cannot drive the two
 * reads while the lab is down or full. Only a door that is open, or not
 * cached, is read live, because the queue ceiling needs a fresh count.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT ENFORCED ATOMICALLY. The queue ceiling is a count read before
 * the write: Cosmos has no cross-document transaction here, so submissions
 * in flight at the same instant can each see 20 and each be written. The
 * overshoot is bounded by those simultaneous submissions that also pass both
 * counters, and the counters are exact, so the queue can never gain more
 * than 50 public jobs a day, nor more than 2 an hour from one client. Making
 * the ceiling exact needs a queued-count document the agent's claim
 * decrements (lib/lab-agent.js), which is a change to the agent protocol and
 * is not made here.
 *
 * THE ONE-DAY TTL. `lab_jobs` has TTL on at the container (default 30 days,
 * infra/cosmos-containers.json), so a document's own `ttl` governs it. Cosmos
 * counts it from the document's last write, so a job lives a day after it
 * finishes. The agent's claim spreads the job it replaces and its
 * completion is a patch (lib/lab-agent.js), so both keep `public` and `ttl`.
 * The job read (public-job.js) refuses a document past its day by its `_ts`.
 *
 * NOTHING REWRITES THE LEARNER'S FILES HERE. ADR 0032 decision 5: the
 * payload keeps its registry `source` and `version` lines, and the
 * `terraform-validate` capability rewrites them to the runner image's
 * vendored copies on its own tmpfs copy inside the job
 * (lab-image/bin/hcw-terraform-validate).
