/**
 * lab-checks.js — the Hybrid Lab checks that keep #1009's failures from
 * coming back unnoticed, each read from what is already stored and judged
 * by a pure function, so the health pulse and the Labs snapshot say the same
 * thing about the same data.
 *
 *   lab-drift       Does every active agent's host run main? The host's
 *                   applied commit (on the agent's registry document)
 *                   against main's lab-host/ and vps-agent/ commits
 *                   (admin_config/lab_drift); labs/drift.js has the rule.
 *   coder-template  Does Coder serve the template of the commit the host
 *                   converged from? The host's Coder upkeep report
 *                   (admin_config/coder_automation) carries the digest of
 *                   what it last published and the digest of its checkout;
 *                   coderTemplateVerdict below compares them.
 *   lab-canary      Did the last real lab job run end to end? The hourly
 *                   canary's record (admin_config/lab_canary, labs/canary.js).
 *   coder-token     Does Coder accept the site's status token? Coder's last
 *                   answers to it (admin_config/coder_status_token,
 *                   labs/coder-status.js recordTokenAnswer).
 *
 * WHY THE TEMPLATE IS COMPARED ON THE HOST'S TWO DIGESTS, NOT THE SITE'S
 * BUILD. A digest of lab-host/coder/templates/hcw-lab computed when the
 * Functions app is built would describe the commit the site was deployed
 * from, and deploys are by hand: a template change merged and bootstrapped
 * before the next deploy would read as a mismatch, and one deployed before
 * the host ran bootstrap.sh would read as fine. The question that failed on
 * 2026-10-08 (finding 8) is narrower and exact: after the host converged, did
 * the publish follow? The host computes both digests with one function
 * (template_digest in hcw-coder-automation.py, over the files
 * hcw-coder-template-push publishes and the autostop it sets), so a pair that
 * differs means one thing. Whether the converged commit is main's is the
 * drift check's question, and the two together cover main → host → Coder.
 *
 * Every verdict is `{ status, summary, detail? }` in the Health Hub's words
 * (health/status-model.js). Nothing here throws on odd data.
