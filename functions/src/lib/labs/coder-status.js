/**
 * GET /api/public/labs/coder-status — the server-side Coder status proxy
 * (#680, Phase 2 of #659; ADR 0032 decision 4).
 *
 * The public labs page shows which Coder templates exist and how many
 * workspaces are running, without the browser ever calling Coder: the SPA's
 * `connect-src` stays closed (frontend/staticwebapp.config.json) and the
 * read-only token never leaves the Function App. The route is anonymous, so
 * it is bounded the way the pricing read is — one document in
 * `tool_service_cache`, refreshed at most once a minute however many visitors
 * open the page (minute-cache.js).
 *
 * THE PANES OPEN ON THIS READ. `/education/labs/<id>` shows a lab's pane only
 * when this answers configured and reachable (LabPanePage.jsx), so those two
 * depend on nothing but Coder's address and Coder answering. Before the lab
 * launcher (2026-09-28) both also needed the status token: the owner's first
 * sign-in could not happen in a pane, because the token that opened the
 * panes was made from that sign-in, and the token's one-year expiry would
 * have closed every pane on the day it lapsed. The token now adds the
 * card's templates and running count, and nothing else.
 *
 * Four answers, all 200, the last three cached for a minute:
 *
 *   { configured: false }
 *       CODER_URL is absent, not an https URL, or still the unresolved
 *       `@Microsoft.KeyVault(…)` literal an unseeded reference arrives as. The
 *       card reads "not yet provisioned". No store read, no network.
 *   { configured: true, reachable: false, templates: [], capacity: { running: null, max }, asOf }
 *       `GET /api/v2/buildinfo` refused, timed out, or answered something
 *       that was not the documented shape.
 *   { configured: true, reachable: true, templates: [], capacity: { running: null, max }, asOf }
 *       Coder answers, and the detail is unknown: CODER_STATUS_TOKEN is
 *       absent or unresolved, Coder refused it (401 or 403, an expired or
 *       revoked token), or the detail calls failed. A warning names the
 *       setting, never its value.
 *   { configured: true, reachable: true, templates: [{ name, activeVersion }], capacity: { running, max }, asOf }
 *
 * `running: null` on a reachable answer is how the card tells "detail
 * unknown" from "no templates yet": with the token working, `running` is
 * always a number (readDetail throws on a missing count). An unknown count is
 * reported as unknown, never as zero.
 *
 * A FAILURE IS CACHED TOO, and it replaces whatever healthy entry was there.
 * A stale-but-healthy document served through a Coder outage would show
 * numbers that are no longer true, so the card says "unreachable" until the
 * next minute's attempt succeeds.
 *
 * Coder endpoints, from https://coder.com/docs/reference/api (retrieved
 * 2026-09-25) and Coder v2.37.3's router (coderd/coderd.go, read
 * 2026-09-28):
 *
 *   GET /api/v2/buildinfo
 *       Unauthenticated (registered outside the API-key middleware), and so
 *       sent with no token at all. `version` is a string.
 *
 * The detail calls carry the `Coder-Session-Token` header, which is how the
 * reference authenticates each of them:
 *
 *   GET /api/v2/templates
 *       codersdk.Template[] — `name`, `active_version_id`, … ; deprecated
 *       templates are omitted unless asked for, which is what the card wants.
 *   GET /api/v2/templateversions/{templateversion}
 *       codersdk.TemplateVersion — `name` is the version a reader recognises;
 *       the template row carries only the version's uuid.
 *   GET /api/v2/workspaces?q=status:running
 *       { count, workspaces[] } — `q` is documented as `key:value` search with
 *       `status` among its keys; `count` is the number matching.
 *
 * What the response carries and what it does not: template names are the
 * slugs the labs card lists, and version names are what an operator would
 * say aloud. No URL, no workspace name, no owner, no id —
 * nothing that describes the deployment beyond those names and two numbers.
 *
 * A REFUSED TOKEN IS RAISED, NOT ONLY ABSORBED (#1009). From 2026-10-06T01:25Z
 * Coder refused the status token for about 32 hours, and the only sign was
 * a card that said "unknown". Now every read that reaches Coder with the
 * token records Coder's answer in admin_config/coder_status_token
 * (recordTokenAnswer): when it last accepted the token, when it last refused
 * it and with which status, and since when it has been refusing. The health
 * pulse raises a refusal newer than the last acceptance as the `coder-token`
 * probe, critical (labs/lab-checks.js). And a 401 writes one warning-level
 * line that starts with TOKEN_REFUSED_401_LOG, content-free (the setting's
 * name and a status, never the token or Coder's address), for a log alert
 * to match. Neither is in the public answer, which says what it always said.
 *
 * EVIDENCE IS KEPT PER OPERATION (CodeRabbit, #1056). The token is used for
 * two different things: the labs status read (`status`: templates and
 * running workspaces, which need template:read and workspace:read) and the
 * Integrations card's expiry read (`expiry`: the token's own key record).
 * Each has its own answer in the record, and a refusal is cleared only by an
 * acceptance of the same operation, so an editor opening Integrations cannot
 * clear a status read's 403 by reading a record the token can still read.
 *
 * THE SCHEDULED CHECK DOES NOT GO THROUGH THE CACHE (CodeRabbit, #1056).
 * Anonymous visitors keep the one-minute cache warm, and a read that finds
 * it warm never asks Coder, so a check riding on that read could go hours
 * without seeing a refusal. `checkToken` asks Coder directly, with the
 * status read's two calls, records the answer, and leaves the cache alone;
 * the hourly lab canary calls it (labs/canary.js).
