/**
 * GET /api/public/labs/estate — "The Hybrid Lab right now" (#664, Phase 4 of
 * #656; ADR 0032 decision 3).
 *
 * The public, live view of the hybrid estate: the Arc-enabled lab host's state
 * as Azure sees it, its policy compliance, whether the `vps-agent` job runner
 * is heartbeating and how deep its queue is, and Coder's capacity from the
 * status proxy beside this module. Read by the Function App's managed identity
 * through Azure Resource Graph under a Reader grant on `rg-lab-hybrid-prod-cus`
 * alone (infra/lab-hybrid.tf) — the browser never sees Azure, and no new
 * credential exists anywhere in the path.
 *
 * Two shapes, both 200, each cached for a minute in `tool_service_cache`:
 *
 *   { configured: false }
 *       Resource Graph returned no Arc machine in the lab resource group —
 *       because the group does not exist yet, or exists and holds no machine.
 *       Both read the same to a visitor: the card says "not yet provisioned",
 *       and nothing is invented to fill it.
 *   { configured: true, arc, policy, agent, coder, asOf }
 *       arc    { status, statusSince, agentVersion, osName } — always present
 *       policy { compliant, nonCompliant, notApplicable } | null
 *       agent  { online, queued, lastHeartbeatAt } | null
 *              online: any lab agent heartbeating (lib/labs.js isAgentOnline);
 *              lastHeartbeatAt: the freshest online agent's, else null
 *       coder  { reachable, running, max } | null
 *
 * NULL MEANS UNKNOWN, NOT ZERO. The three side reads — policy, agent queue,
 * Coder — are independent of the Arc row and of each other, and one of them
 * failing must not sink the others or, worse, become a number. `policy` is
 * `{ compliant: 0, nonCompliant: 0 }` only when Resource Graph answered and
 * counted nothing; a failed policy query is `null`. The same rule applies to
 * `agent` (a store failure) and `coder` (its own module says unconfigured, or
 * threw).
 *
 * When the Arc read itself fails — ARM refused, the token could not be minted,
 * the call timed out — the route answers **503**, not `{ configured: false }`:
 * "we cannot see the estate" and "there is no estate" are different sentences
 * and the card should say the first. That 503 is cached for the same minute
 * as a success, so an outage never turns anonymous page loads into a stream
 * of management-plane calls.
 *
 * `arc.statusSince` IS NOT A HEARTBEAT. Azure Resource Manager exposes no
 * heartbeat timestamp on an Arc machine; the row's
 * `properties.lastStatusChange` is the time the agent's status last changed,
 * and the agent's status becomes Disconnected on its own once heartbeats
 * stop. Until #1009 this field was called `lastHeartbeatAt` and the card
 * printed it as "Last heartbeat", so a host connected without a break for
 * three days read "Last heartbeat: 3 days ago". It is the moment the status
 * beside it began, and is named so. The Log Analytics `Heartbeat` table
 * would be exact, and would need a workspace grant this route does not have
 * (ADR 0032 decision 3 keeps the identity's reach to the one resource group).
 * The heartbeat a visitor can read is the job runner's own:
 * `agent.lastHeartbeatAt`, from `lab_agents` (lib/lab-agent.js).
 *
 * THE POLICY COUNTS ARE OF CHECKS THAT CAN EVALUATE THIS LAB. The group
 * inherits the subscription's security benchmark as well as holding the
 * one assignment infra/lab-hybrid.tf makes, and several of those can never
 * pass here, by design rather than by fault. Counted as non-compliant they
 * made the card say the host failed checks it could not take. They are
 * counted apart, as `notApplicable`, each for the reason in
 * NOT_APPLICABLE_POLICIES, and only while their result is NonCompliant: a
 * check on the list that does report Compliant evaluated, and is counted so.
 *
 * The response names no host. The machine's `name` is its hostname, and the
 * queries here never project it: status, timestamps, an agent version and an
 * OS name are the entire disclosure, and each of those is already public on
 * the lab's pages by design.
 *
 * KQL, checked against the Resource Graph references on 2026-09-25 —
 * https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/servers/resource-graph-samples
 * (`properties.status`, `properties.osName`, `type =~
 * 'microsoft.hybridcompute/machines'`), the `@azure/arm-hybridcompute`
 * MachineProperties reference (`lastStatusChange`, `status`, `agentVersion`),
 * and https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/samples/resource-graph-samples
 * (`policyresources`, `microsoft.policyinsights/policystates`,
 * `tostring(properties.complianceState)`, and, read 2026-10-08,
 * `properties.policyAssignmentName`; `policyDefinitionName` is the policy
 * state's definition name, the GUID for a built-in). String literals are
 * single-quoted throughout, as KQL requires.
 *
 * Shaped like cloud-tools/explain/handler.js: each read is a module-scope
 * step over a `deps` object, so the factory below only wires them. One place
 * turns the built result into a response, one place turns a throw into 500.
