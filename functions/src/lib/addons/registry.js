/**
 * The closed registry of AddOns the status proxy may read (ADR 0035; the
 * HCW AddOn Integration Standard, section 10).
 *
 * `GET /api/public/addons/{id}/status` is anonymous and takes `id` from the
 * path, so the ids are closed HERE, server side: a visitor can make the
 * Function App read the health of an AddOn this table names and nothing
 * else, whatever the path says. The address itself comes from the app
 * setting the entry names (`ADDON_<ID>_URL`, a plain Terraform setting in
 * infra/functionapp.tf, public because it is already in the site's CSP),
 * never from the request.
 *
 * The site's catalogue (frontend/src/data/addons/catalogue.js) holds the
 * same ids and health paths; its test reads this file and fails when the
 * two drift. An entry here whose setting is unset answers
 * `{ configured: false }`, which is how a `coming` row stays closed.
