/**
 * How many published items each `/<provider>/<section>` page has, so the
 * pre-render can keep a section with nothing in it out of `sitemap.xml`
 * (issue #373).
 *
 * ## Why this is server-side
 *
 * `scripts/build-content-manifest.mjs` counted `framework` items itself, from
 * the corpus this route already returns. That works for exactly one section:
 * frameworks read the `content` container and nothing else. Every other
 * section page reads something the builder cannot see —
 *
 *   - `blog`, `coder-corner` and `code` fall back to the legacy `blogs`
 *     container when `content` has nothing for that provider
 *     (useBlogData.js, useCoderCornerData.js, useFrameworkData.js). Measured
 *     2026-09-07: `blogs` holds five published documents and every one of
 *     them is a slug-duplicate of a `content` document, so the fallback
 *     currently puts nothing on any page — but it is reached on precisely the
 *     providers this whole mechanism declares empty, so a count that read
 *     `content` alone would be a count of a different set of documents than
 *     the page reads. Retiring the fallback is a separate decision about
 *     data; counting both containers is correct either way, and costs one
 *     bounded query.
 *   - `audio` and `audio-architecture` read `podcasts` and
 *     `listen_and_learn_episodes` (useAudioEpisodes.js), neither of which is
 *     content at all.
 *
 * So the counting moves to the app, which already holds Cosmos access to all
 * four containers, and the builder fetches the answer with the corpus.
 *
 * ## The counts mean what the page shows
 *
 * Each rule below mirrors one hook, filter for filter — the same public
 * predicate (`isPublicDocument`, not this route's own `PUBLISHED_PREDICATE`,
 * which answers a different question for a different consumer), the same type
 * test, the same provider matching. The one liberty taken is that a section's
 * two containers are SUMMED where the hook prefers `content` and falls back to
 * `blogs`. The sum differs from what the page displays whenever both hold
 * items — but it is zero exactly when the page is empty, and zero is the only
 * value anything acts on.
 *
 * ## Nothing here is allowed to guess
 *
 * A zero drops a URL out of the sitemap, so a zero that is really an "I don't
 * know" is the expensive mistake. Two guards:
 *
 *   - `_unattributed` counts items of a section's type that name no
 *     recognised provider, for the sections whose page INFERS a provider from
 *     titles, summaries and URLs when the document does not carry one
 *     (`blog`, `frameworks`). Such an item can surface on any provider's
 *     page, so while one exists no provider's zero for that section is
 *     trusted — `sitemapRoutes` in frontend/scripts/prerender.mjs reads the
 *     bucket for exactly that. The remaining sections filter on a stored
 *     field in SQL (`c.provider = @provider`, or the `Cloud Provider` alias
 *     match), so an item naming no recognised provider is fetched by no page
 *     and is deliberately counted nowhere: putting it in `_unattributed`
 *     would block sixteen audio pages on behalf of two podcast rows that no
 *     visitor can reach.
 *
 *     `provider: 'main'` on a `podcasts` row is not such a row and must not be
 *     mistaken for one. It is the site's own show: the listing returns it to
 *     every provider and every provider's audio page shows it, so it is
 *     counted for each of them BY NAME rather than parked in the "could
 *     surface anywhere" bucket. `_unattributed` says we do not know which
 *     pages an item reaches; for the show we do.
 *   - `countSections` returns null when any query fills its window, because a
 *     truncated read cannot tell an absent item from an unread one. The route
 *     then answers `sections: null` — the key is present and null, not absent,
 *     which is the same thing a caller sees either way because the consumer
 *     tests the VALUE: `serverSections()` in scripts/build-content-manifest.mjs
 *     treats null, and anything else that is not a plain object, as "no counts
 *     from the route" and falls back to its own frameworks-only count. A
 *     deployed revision predating the field omits the key entirely and lands in
 *     the same branch, which is why the two cases need no telling apart.

 *   coder-corner, code  — useCoderCornerData: type coder_corner, provider sent
 *                         to the API and matched there against PROVIDER_ALIASES.
 *                         Both sections render the same query for the same
 *                         provider (ProviderCodeDispatcher in App.jsx), so they
 *                         carry the same number.

 *   audio-architecture    for that provider, plus every episode of the site's
 *                         own show, which the listing returns to all of them.
 *                         Both routes render
 *                         SharedPodcastPage for the provider in the path, so
 *                         they too carry the same number.
 *   architecture-designs — each provider's ArchitecturePage: type architecture,
 *                         provider read from the same two fields this file
 *                         matches. See below for why it is counted now when it
 *                         deliberately was not before.
 *
 * WHY `architecture-designs` IS HERE NOW. It was left out on purpose, and the
 * reason was sound: its pages merge API documents with `staticBlueprints`, a
 * list hardcoded in each provider's ArchitecturePage.jsx, so a count of zero
 * said nothing about whether the page was empty — on 2026-09-07 the corpus held
 * ONE architecture document while four of the five pages rendered fine. Acting
 * on that zero would have dropped four working URLs to fix the one broken one.
 *
 * What changed is where the hardcoded lists live, not what they contain. Each
 * page's blueprints moved to a sibling `architecture-blueprints.js` that the
 * pre-render imports and counts (issue #373), so "does this page have static
 * content?" is now a question the build can answer per provider instead of a
 * property only a human reading JSX could see. This count supplies the other
 * half of the same question — how many API documents reach the page — and
 * `sitemapRoutes` drops a route only when both halves are zero. So a zero here
 * is no longer load-bearing on its own, which is precisely what made it unsafe
 * to produce before.
 *
 * `providerInferred: true` needs its own justification, because the inference
 * is not the text-matching kind `blog` and `frameworks` do. Four of the five
 * pages filter with `(doc.cloudProvider || doc['Cloud Provider'] || 'aws')` —
 * their OWN slug as the default — so an architecture document naming no
 * recognised provider appears on the AWS, Azure, FinOps and GCP pages alike.
 * That is exactly the "could surface on any provider's page" the unattributed
 * bucket exists for. The VMware page is the exception: it defaults to `''` and
 * so shows such a document nowhere, which means the bucket is conservative for
 * the one route this whole mechanism can actually drop. Conservative is the
 * error to choose — it keeps an empty page advertised, where the opposite
 * mistake unadvertises a page that has content.
