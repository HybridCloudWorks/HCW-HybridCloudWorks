/**
 * ai-provider-probe.js — `probeAiProviders`, weekly on Monday at 06:15 UTC
 * (#701, owner decision 2026-09-29).
 *
 * That day NVIDIA's trial tier became the BACKUP for content features
 * (PROVIDER_PLACEMENT_DEFAULTS in lib/ai/ai-config.js). Measured through the
 * portal's Test, it took 56-117 s to answer one word, and once the Test was
 * capped at 16 tokens and 45 s it did not answer at all. The owner was
 * promised a weekly re-check, so that a feature can move back to 'first' on
 * evidence rather than on memory.
 *
 * This is that re-check, and it is the Test, not a second instrument. It runs
 * `testProviderConnection` from lib/ai/proxy.js, the code behind the Test
 * button, with the same one-word prompt, the same 16-token cap and the same
 * 45 s limit. It writes the same fields onto each provider document, plus
 * `lastTestedBy: 'probe'`. So the AI Engine card shows a probe result the way
 * it shows a click: "Tested 2d ago by the weekly check", the latency beside
 * the Connected badge, or the error ("timeout after 45000 ms") under it.
 *
 * EVERY PROVIDER WITH A KEY, NOT ONLY NVIDIA. Whether NVIDIA should go first
 * is a comparison with the paid providers, and a latency means little
 * without theirs, measured the same minute from the same instance. A key is
 * the router's own definition of "configured" (router.js header). The
 * portal's enabled switch is not consulted, for the reason the Test is not
 * feature-gated (proxy.js header): a provider switched off is exactly one
 * whose evidence someone may want before switching it back on. The cost is
 * the Test's, one short call per provider a week, a fraction of a cent in
 * all. The Usage tab lists it as its own source ('ai-engine:probe'), and
 * NVIDIA's rows price at zero.
 *
 * One provider at a time, so no call's wait overlaps another's measurement.
 * The worst case, every provider timing out, is four times 45 s, well inside
 * the host's default function timeout.
 *
 * A provider that fails is a RESULT, not a failure of the timer. The run
 * returns it, the card shows it, and the timer succeeds. The timer throws
 * only when it cannot run at all.
