/**
 * newsletter-autobuild.js — build the weekly newsletter into Drafts every
 * Monday and tell the owner on Telegram (owner decision 2026-09-13, #504).
 *
 * **This never sends.** It calls the issue builder with `keep: true`, which
 * writes a `draft` with `savedAt` set so the issue shows on the Drafts tab of
 * the Newsletter Hub page. Nothing here reaches Resend, and nothing here approves:
 * the only way an issue reaches subscribers is the owner pressing Approve on
 * that tab (ADR 0029 §1b, ADR 0030 §2a).
 *
 * It passes no `days`: how far back to look, which sections and whether an
 * intro is written are Newsletter settings → Content (#557), read by the
 * builder, so the Monday build and the Build button follow the same choices.
 *
 * The builder's refusals are kept, not worked around. If today's issue is
 * already saved to Drafts, or has been approved, scheduled or sent, the build
 * writes nothing and the message says so. A week with nothing new builds
 * nothing. Neither is an error: the timer returns normally, so the host does
 * not record a failure for an outcome that is the builder doing its job.
 *
 * The notification is best-effort (notify.js never throws). A build that
 * throws — Cosmos unreachable, say — is reported and then rethrown, so the
 * failure is visible both on Telegram and in the Functions host.
