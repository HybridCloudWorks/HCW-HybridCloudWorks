/**
 * agent-health.js — `checkAgentHealth`, every 5 minutes (T-401), and the two
 * messages the owner gets about a lab agent: offline, and back.
 *
 * The Labs VPS agent heartbeats every 30 s (lib/lab-agent.js writes
 * `lastSeenAt`). Each run reads the registry once and decides three things
 * from that one read (planAgentHealth, pure):
 *
 *   1. MARK. An agent that has not heartbeated for STALE_AFTER_MS — the same
 *      90 s (three missed beats) the online rule uses — and is not already
 *      `offline` is marked `offline`. `offlineSince` is its last heartbeat,
 *      when it went quiet, not when this run happened to notice. An agent
 *      that announces its own shutdown is marked by its heartbeat instead
 *      (lib/lab-agent.js), at once.
 *   2. SAY IT IS OFFLINE, once it has been offline OFFLINE_NOTIFY_AFTER_MS
 *      (5 minutes) or more, and once per outage: `offlineNotifiedAt` on the
 *      agent's own document records the message, so a restart, a second
 *      instance or the next run cannot repeat it. An agent the registry has
 *      deactivated is marked but never announced: it cannot heartbeat at all
 *      (auth/require-agent.js, gate 2), so its silence is on purpose.
 *   3. SAY IT IS BACK. lib/lab-agent.js sends that on the first normal
 *      heartbeat after an outage the owner was told about. This run sends it
 *      when that attempt did not go (the notifier's cooldown, Telegram
 *      down), so every "offline" is followed by one "back online".
 *
 * WHY FIVE MINUTES (#1009). Until 2026-10-08 the heartbeat that announced a
 * graceful stop sent a critical "Lab agent offline" at once. That day's 04:30
 * reboot was back in 43 seconds, and the owner had a red alert and no word
 * that it was over. A restart now says nothing; an outage that outlasts five
 * minutes says so once, and its end says so once.
 *
 * AN OUTAGE THE OWNER WAS TOLD ABOUT LASTS UNTIL THEY ARE TOLD IT ENDED. If
 * the agent drops again before the "back online" went, `offlineSince` keeps
 * the first start and no second "offline" is sent, so the owner reads one
 * outage with one start and one end.
 *
 * Every state change is logged at warn. host.json holds Function logs at
 * Warning, so the information line this used to write ("N agent(s) marked
 * offline") was never ingested, and a mark could not be found afterwards.
 * Those lines are content-free, counts and never document ids, and so is the
 * run's result; the owner's message, which is not telemetry, names the agent.
 *
 * A MARK IS A DECISION FROM A READ, so it is written with that read's ETag.
 * A heartbeat that lands between this run's read and its mark has made the
 * agent fresh again; an unguarded mark would overwrite it with `offline` and
 * could send a false outage message. The guarded mark loses with a 412
 * instead, and this run leaves that agent to the next one (review of #1018).
 * The stamps that record a message went (`offlineNotifiedAt`, the "back
 * online" clear) are not guarded: they record a fact about the message, true
 * whatever else changed on the document.
