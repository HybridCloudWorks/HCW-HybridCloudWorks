/**
 * timers/reminders.js — `sendReminders`, daily at 13:00 UTC (08:00 Central).
 *
 * Reads the owner's reminders sheet (admin_config/reminders, written from
 * Platform Settings → Reminders; shape in lib/reminders/settings.js) and says
 * on Telegram, through the shared notifier, each reminder whose stage has
 * come: once within its lead days, once on the day, then weekly while it is
 * overdue, until it is marked done. Owner request 2026-10-06.
 *
 * A stage is stamped on the reminder only when the notifier reports the
 * message sent, so an unconfigured bot or a Telegram error means the same
 * reminder is tried again tomorrow rather than counted as said.
 *
 * Two writers share the document: this timer stamps, the sheet edits. The
 * stamps are written with the document's ETag and, when the sheet saved in
 * between (412), re-read and re-applied onto the rows as they now stand — a
 * row the owner removed meanwhile stays removed, a row they edited keeps the
 * edit, and only `notified` gains the stage. The sheet's own PUT merges the
 * other way (platform-settings.js, `merge`), so a stamp written while the
 * page was open survives the save. Review of #910.
 *
 * A STAMP BELONGS TO THE CYCLE IT WAS SAID FOR (review of #1039): the row's
 * due date and title when the message went. On a re-apply after a 412 it is
 * written only onto a row that still has that date and title. A row that
 * moved meanwhile (the owner re-dated it, or a rotation recorded on
 * Integrations → Credentials started the register row's next cycle) gets no
 * stamp, so its new cycle is said afresh rather than counted as said by a
 * message about the old one. With no conflict the rows are the ones the
 * stamps were computed from, so nothing changes there.
 *
 * Telemetry carries positions and counts, never a reminder's id: ids may be
 * chosen by hand and a hand-chosen id is content.
 *
 * Each reminder is its own notifier source (`reminder:<id>`), so the
 * notifier's fifteen-minute cooldown never lets one reminder silence another.
 *
 * Since #1026 a run first brings the credential register's rows in line
 * (`syncCredentials`, lib/credentials/reminders.js): a Key Vault secret
 * rotated on the Keys tab since yesterday has moved its reminder before
 * anything is said, so no message is built from a stale due date. A sync
 * that fails is a warning and the run goes on with the sheet as it stands.
