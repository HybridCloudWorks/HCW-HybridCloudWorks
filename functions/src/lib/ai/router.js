/**
 * router.js — one door to the text models, for every AI handler (T-322 §4.4).
 *
 * Ported from Site-Main `lib/ai-model-router.js` (088f458). A key makes a
 * provider POSSIBLE: seed `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` or
 * `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and that provider becomes available; seed none and every
 * AI handler fails with `AI_NOT_CONFIGURED` — a plain sentence, not a stack
 * trace.
 *
 * Since 2026-08-23 a key is necessary but no longer sufficient. The admin
 * portal's AI Engine page decides which of the available providers are actually
 * used, in what order, and which parts of the site may call one at all. That
 * configuration is read by `ai-config.js`, which also carries the rules for
 * what happens when it disagrees with reality — read its header before changing
 * anything here. In short: configuration can disable and reorder, never enable;
 * an unreadable configuration changes nothing.
 *
 * Default order is Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, and the order now FAILS OVER: a
 * provider that cannot serve a call (rejected key, unknown model, dead endpoint)
 * hands on to the next one rather than failing the call. A bad request does not
 * fail over, because it would fail identically everywhere. `callWithFailover`
 * carries the reasoning. `CONTENTFORGE_AI_PROVIDER` still pins one outright —
 * and a pin does NOT fall through, because it is an instruction rather than a
 * preference.
 *
 * What is gone from upstream and why:
 *   - Vertex. It authenticates with Application Default Credentials — a GCP
 *     identity the Function App cannot hold. Gemini is reached through the
 *     public Gemini API with an API key instead (same model names).
 *   - Azure OpenAI. Retired with the account (Migration-Plan note).
 *   - axios. `fetch` is global on Node 24 (and has been since 18); one less dependency.
 *
 * What is kept: the purpose → model table (env-overridable per provider), JSON
 * sanitising with a repair round trip, retry on 408/429/5xx, per-call usage
 * capture with cost estimates, the Anthropic prompt-cache marker.
 *
 * ONE DOOR, TWO GEMINI ENDPOINTS (#433, 2026-09-09). Everything above goes
 * through each provider's chat endpoint — for Gemini, `models/{m}:generateContent`
 * — and fails over along the chain. `generateGroundedJsonResponse` is the one
 * exception: it grounds a generation on owner-supplied web pages and YouTube
 * videos, and Google accepts a YouTube URL ONLY through its Interactions API
 * (`/v1beta/interactions`), which is also where the `url_context` tool lives.
 * That endpoint is not new to this repository — `listen-and-learn/speech/gemini.js`
 * has rendered dialogue through it since 2026-08-24 — so it is the same door the
 * speech side uses, not a second client. What goes through it: a grounded call,
 * and nothing else. What does not: every existing call site, the JSON repair
 * round trip, `callProvider`. And a grounded call does not fail over, because
 * only Gemini can read either source and the next provider down would answer,
 * successfully, from the prompt alone. The provider chain is still resolved
 * exactly as for every other call — portal order, disabled providers, the
 * `CONTENTFORGE_AI_PROVIDER` pin — and Gemini has to be in it; if it is not,
 * the call says why and stops.
 *
 * Interactions contract, verified against https://ai.google.dev/api/interactions-api,
 * https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/url-context and
 * https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/video-understanding on 2026-09-09:
 *
 *   POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/interactions
 *   x-goog-api-key: <key>
 *   { model,
 *     input: [ {type:'text', text}, {type:'video', uri:'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=…'} ],
 *     tools: [ {type:'url_context'} ],
 *     system_instruction: '<plain string>',
 *     response_format: { type:'text', mime_type:'application/json', schema? } }
 *
 *   response: { status: 'completed'|'failed'|'incomplete'|'in_progress'|
 *                       'requires_action'|'cancelled'|'budget_exceeded'|'queued',
 *               steps: [ {type:'model_output', content:[{type:'text', text}]},
 *                        {type:'url_context_result', result:[{status, url}]} ],
 *               usage: { total_input_tokens, total_output_tokens,
 *                        total_thought_tokens, total_tool_use_tokens, … },
 *               errors: [{code, message}] }
 *
 *   `generation_config` has NO `temperature` (its fields are max_output_tokens,
 *   seed, stop_sequences, thinking_level, tool_choice and the media configs),
 *   so the 0.2 the chat endpoints use cannot be set here and is not. YouTube:
 *   public videos only, at most 10 per request on 2.5+ models. url_context: at
 *   most 20 URLs per request; YouTube and paywalled pages are not readable
 *   through it, and each retrieval reports `success|error|paywall|unsafe`.
 *   `total_tool_use_tokens` is "tokens present in tool-use prompt(s)", i.e. the
 *   fetched pages, so it is counted as INPUT; thought tokens as output, as on
 *   the chat endpoint. Whether `total_output_tokens` already includes thoughts
 *   is not stated on the reference page — if it does, the output count here
 *   over-reads by that amount.
 *
 * NVIDIA API CATALOG (#701, 2026-09-25). A fourth provider, `nvidia`, on the
 * OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint at https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1 with
 * `NVIDIA_API_KEY` as a Bearer token. It is a trial tier — free, about 40
 * requests a minute per account, trial terms — so it differs from the other
 * three in four deliberate ways:
 *
 *   - Its place in the chain is set PER FEATURE (ai-config.js,
 *     PER_FEATURE_PROVIDERS): for owner-triggered content it is the backup,
 *     after the paid providers, unless an administrator places it first for
 *     a feature (owner decision 2026-09-29; it was first by default from
 *     2026-09-25 until then). It is never used for the anonymous public
 *     explain route, and a call with no feature never uses it.
 *   - A pacing guard keeps this instance under the account limit. A call the
 *     guard refuses is not sent and fails over at once, so a burst of batch
 *     drafts degrades to the paid providers instead of failing.
 *   - A 400/422 from it fails over. "A bad request fails identically
 *     everywhere" holds for three frontier APIs; it does not hold for a
 *     catalogue of open-weight models with their own context and parameter
 *     limits, where the next provider will very likely take the same request.
 *     A part WE refused (AI_PART_REFUSED) still does not fail over.
 *   - Its usage rows are priced at zero, so the Usage tab shows the calls and
 *     the saving rather than an invented figure.
 *
 * SYNCHRONOUS CALLS HAVE A TIME BUDGET (2026-09-29). A route that answers a
 * browser holds the request open while the model works. The request dies at
 * the client's timeout (frontend lib/api.js: 90 s for a draft, 20 s by
 * default) or at the edge's ~100 s, whichever comes first. On 2026-09-29
 * NVIDIA's reasoning models took 56-58 s to reply with one word, and an
 * NVIDIA attempt may run 120 s. With NVIDIA first for drafting, the failover
 * to a paid provider started after nobody was listening. `budgetMs` on
 * generateTextResponse and generateJsonResponse is the fix. The arithmetic is
 * in time-budget.js; the contract is here:
 *
 *   - The clock starts when the call is made. It covers the configuration
 *     read, every provider, every retry and the JSON repair round trip.
 *   - Half of the budget is the failover reserve. A provider with another
 *     behind it stops early enough to leave the reserve, unless that would
 *     leave it less than MIN_ATTEMPT_MS. Then it may use all that is left,
 *     and so may the last provider.
 *   - Each attempt's timeout is the provider's own (120 s for NVIDIA, 60 s
 *     for the rest), cut to what is left of its share. It travels as the
 *     same per-call `timeoutMs` that the portal's Test passes, not as a
 *     second mechanism.
 *   - A retry is made only if its share still holds MIN_ATTEMPT_MS after the
 *     backoff. No attempt is started once less than that is left.
 *   - When less than MIN_ATTEMPT_MS is left and providers are still untried,
 *     the call fails with AI_BUDGET_EXHAUSTED (status 504). The error names
 *     each provider tried, why it failed, and which were never reached.
 *   - Pacing, the retry and failover rules, usage capture and key verdicts
 *     are unchanged.
 *
 * No budget means no change. The background paths pass none: forge jobs,
 * the schedulers, the change feed and every queue worker. They keep the full
 * timeouts and three attempts. The grounded call and `callProvider` take no
 * budget. The synchronous routes that pass one, and the client timeouts they
 * must fit under, are pinned in sync-budgets.test.js. On the trial tier's
 * measured latency, NVIDIA will seldom finish inside a synchronous share.
 * What the budget guarantees is that it can no longer stop the provider
 * behind it from answering. Since 2026-09-29 NVIDIA is not first by
 * default, so the NVIDIA case above arises only where an administrator
 * places it first; the budget still bounds any other slow first provider.
 * The weekly probe (lib/timers/ai-provider-probe.js) is the evidence for
 * placing it first again.
 *
 * MICROSOFT FOUNDRY (#849, 2026-10-04). A fifth provider, `foundry`, on the
 * OpenAI-compatible v1 chat endpoint of a Foundry account the estate owns
 * (infra/foundry.tf): `${FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT}/openai/v1/chat/completions`, with
 * the deployment name in `model`. Owner decision that day: of a USD 75 a
 * month budget, the first call is Foundry as a PAID provider for content,
 * with the cheapest text models — gpt-5-nano ($0.05 in / $0.40 out per 1M
 * tokens) for short calls and gpt-5-mini ($0.25 / $2.00) for drafts and
 * analysis. It differs from the other four in three ways:
 *
 *   - NO KEY. The account has local authentication off; the Function App's
 *     system-assigned identity holds "Cognitive Services OpenAI User" and
 *     the router sends an Entra token for the audience the Foundry v1
 *     endpoint documents, https://ai.azure.com (FOUNDRY_TOKEN_SCOPE in the
 *     environment overrides it), fetched through @azure/identity and cached
 *     until five minutes before it expires. What makes the provider POSSIBLE is the
 *     endpoint setting, which Terraform writes from the account; KEY_ENV
 *     names it so every "has a key" check reads the same way. Locally,
 *     `FOUNDRY_API_KEY` set in functions/.env sends an api-key header
 *     instead, for a developer's own account.
 *   - PLACED PER FEATURE, like NVIDIA: 'first' for the content features the
 *     owner triggers, 'off' for the anonymous public explain route and for
 *     the Gemini-only grounded call (features-catalogue.js).
 *   - Its spend has its own Cost Management budget on the `ai` resource
 *     group (USD 75, alerts at 50/90/100 %), beside the subscription one.
 *
 * ONE RESOLVER DECIDES THE CHAIN (ADR 0034 slice 3, #858, 2026-10-05). The
 * per-feature placement and the per-task routes described above are how
 * the chain was decided until that day; they are now READ through the
 * selection document, `admin_settings/ai-routing` version 2 (selection.js:
 * the Priority list and each task's mode and chain). The config loader
 * migrates a stored v1 document, the placements and the card pins into
 * that shape in memory (migrate-selection.js), and `chainDetails` hands the
 * document, the model catalogue and what holds a key to `selectChain`
 * (select.js), which answers the ordered candidates and why each other one
 * was turned away. The locks the placement defaults carried — the trial
 * tier never on the public explain route, grounding Gemini-only — are the
 * resolver's policy locks, and no document lifts them. What stays here is
 * the router's own: the feature switch, the key check, the
 * `CONTENTFORGE_AI_PROVIDER` pin, failover, retries, budgets and usage.
 *
 * THE AUDIO AND IMAGE TASKS READ THE SAME DOCUMENT (ADR 0034 slice 5, #860).
 * Listen & Learn speech, the podcast voice, the cover art and the manual
 * images are tasks in the registry with `needs` of `tts` or `image`, and
 * ElevenLabs and Replicate are providers the resolver knows: keyed is
 * enabled for them (MEDIA_KEY_ENV; no card, no switch), they are listed in
 * `availability` beside the chat providers, and they never join the
 * Priority list or this router's chat chain — `callWithFailover` has no
 * caller for them and never sees them, because a chat task's `needs` turn
 * them away. `modelForTask` is the one door the media call sites use: the
 * task's effective chain through `chainDetails` (the feature switch, the
 * pin and the resolver all apply), and the first candidate's provider and
 * model back, with the reason and the rejected candidates. The adapters
 * keep their own voices, licences and settings; only the model moved.
 *
 * A Key Vault reference that did not resolve arrives as the literal
 * `@Microsoft.KeyVault(...)` string. That is not a key; `readKey` says so.
