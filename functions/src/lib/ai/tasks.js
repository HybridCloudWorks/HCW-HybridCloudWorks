/**
 * tasks.js — the AI task registry (ADR 0034 slice 1, #856).
 *
 * Every piece of work the site sends to a model is a task here: what it is
 * called, what it does, what an administrator will notice when it is off,
 * what kind of answer it needs (`modality`), the capabilities a model must
 * carry to serve it (`needs`), whether anonymous visitors can trigger it
 * (`public`), and the model the site recommends for it with the reason.
 *
 * `features-catalogue.js` derives AI_FEATURES (label, description, route) from
 * this table, so the feature switches, the call-site test and the portal's
 * toggles keep working unchanged; the ids are the feature names. The
 * catalogue (slice 2), the resolver (slice 3) and the Tasks tab (slice 4)
 * read `modality`, `needs` and `recommended`.
 *
 * RECOMMENDATIONS ARE CLAIMS WITH A DATE. Each names a provider and a model
 * the cost table prices (tasks.test.js refuses an unpriced one), and says
 * why in terms of cost, quality and measured latency, with the day the
 * claim was made. The weekly probe and the usage page are what contradict a
 * stale one; the fix is a new line here with a new date, reviewed like any
 * other code.
 *
 * Owner decisions behind the choices (2026-10-04): Microsoft Foundry is the
 * paid provider for content work, first for the content features and never
 * for the public explain route; GPT-5 mini for anything that reads a whole
 * draft or article, nano for short answers. The public route stays on
 * Gemini Flash-Lite, the cheapest fast model the owner has run there since
 * 2026-08-23. Source grounding is Gemini by construction (router.js header).
 *
 * THE AUDIO AND IMAGE TASKS (ADR 0034 slice 5, #860). Listen & Learn
 * speech, the podcast voice, the cover art and the manual images are tasks
 * here with their own `needs` (`tts`, `image`), and their call sites read
 * the selection document through the router's `modelForTask` instead of a
 * model field of their own; the settings pages that carried those fields
 * lost them. Each recommends the model that was its default the day before
 * — the migration (migrate-selection.js) turns a stored choice that
 * differed into that task's custom chain, so nothing changed for the owner
 * on merge. They default to mode `recommended` (`defaultMode`) because the
 * Priority list is a chat list and a media provider never joins it: a media
 * task in `global` mode would have nothing eligible. Three more tasks —
 * `recordingTranscript` (stt), `pageOcr` (ocr), `embeddings` (embedding) —
 * are registered with no provider carrying their need yet (`planned`): the
 * Tasks tab shows them as "no eligible model" rather than omitting them,
 * they have no feature switch and no call site, and `recommended` is null
 * because a recommendation nobody can serve would be a claim about nothing.
 *
 * `only` IS A PRODUCT RULE IN CODE, and no document lifts it (select.js
 * policy locks): the podcast voice is ElevenLabs and only ElevenLabs,
 * Listen & Learn is read by Gemini and never by ElevenLabs (ADR 0029 §2b;
 * Azure AI Speech is the adapter's own fallback, not a catalogue provider),
 * and the images are made by the one Replicate client. Without it the
 * Priority list's Gemini step, judged on Gemini's TTS recommendation, would
 * read the podcast the day the ElevenLabs recommendation was not yet
 * confirmed by a refresh.
