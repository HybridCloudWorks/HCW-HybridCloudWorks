 * can judge a model the catalogue has not listed yet — a pinned id before the
 * first refresh — without importing the catalogue module, which imports the
 * router, which imports the resolver. Pricing is deliberately NOT here: it
 * reads COST_TABLE on the router, and model-catalog.js composes the two.

/**
 * Capabilities and context by id pattern, first match wins. Small and
 * honest: a context is written only where the provider publishes one for
 * the family, and a model that is not a chat model (realtime, audio in,
 * transcription, embeddings, moderation, video) carries no capability at
 * all until a call path exists for it — the task registry lists `stt`,
 * `ocr` and `embedding` as planned (tasks.js), and a capability nobody can
 * call would make a model selectable for a task that then fails.
 *
 * The audio and image rows (ADR 0034 slice 5, #860) come first because the
 * Gemini TTS ids start with `gemini-` and would otherwise read as chat
 * models: `*-tts` and ElevenLabs's `eleven_*` carry `tts`; Replicate's
 * image models and Gemini's `imagen-*` carry `image`. Pricing is never
 * here (model-catalog-doc.js pricingFor).
 *
 * `modality` is the kind of answer the model is listed for, in the task
 * registry's vocabulary (tasks.js MODALITIES); null for a model whose
 * modality that registry does not name yet.
