 * case are in the ai-config.js header.
 *
 * DEPRECATED: the per-feature placement (ADR 0034 slice 3, #858). The router
 * no longer calls `applyFeaturePlacement`; the selection document carries
 * what a placement said (migrate-selection.js: `first` → a custom chain,
 * `off` → `exclude`), and its locks are the resolver's policy locks
 * (select.js). Slice 4 (#859) removed the "Where AI is used" placement
 * controls and the API's placement field; `placementFor` and
 * `PROVIDER_PLACEMENT_DEFAULTS` stay because migrate-selection.js imports
 * them — a stored v1 document and its placements are read through them
 * until the first v2 save, and `defaultSelection()` is built from the
 * defaults here. `applyFeaturePlacement` is called by nothing but
 * ai-config.test.js and the "before" half of select.contract.test.js. The
 * feature switches (`isFeatureEnabled`, AI_FEATURES) are not deprecated.

 * there costs nothing visible, because the router hands it to the next

 * ceiling and trial terms are weakest. One global position cannot express

 *
 *   'first'  ahead of the global order — the free model writes, the paid ones
 *            are the failover.

 *            when every provider above it cannot serve.
 *   'off'    never in this feature's chain.

 * Its global position still exists (it is last in DEFAULT_PROVIDER_ORDER, and

/**
 * The placement each feature gets when configuration says nothing, and the

 *
 * 'off' HERE IS A LOCK, not a default. The header's first rule is that
 * configuration can reorder and disable, never enable, and a feature whose
 * code-level placement is 'off' is one where routing to the trial tier is not
 * a decision an administrator can make from a toggle:
 *
 *   pricingExplain, landingZoneExplain — the anonymous public explain route.
 *     Unauthenticated traffic against a 40 RPM trial account, under trial
 *     terms, is exactly the use the issue ruled out.
 *   altText — sends images; the default NVIDIA models are chosen for text.
 *   sourceGrounding — Gemini-only by construction (router.js header).
 *
 * A feature missing from this table is 'off' too, so a new feature arrives
 * without the trial tier until someone decides otherwise — the opposite of
 * rule 3, deliberately: rule 3 is about the feature running at all, this is
 * about a trial-tier provider joining it.
 *
 * Content features the owner triggers were 'first' from #701 until 2026-09-29,
 * then 'order' (owner decision that day). Measured through the portal's Test:
 * the free tier took 56-117 s to say "ok" with the drafting limits, and did not
 * answer 16 tokens inside 45 s once the Test was capped (#806), so the delay is
 * the trial tier queueing, not the model thinking. As 'first' every
 * synchronous call waited out NVIDIA's budget share (about 35 s, #807) before
 * the paid provider answered, and every background call waited up to two
 * minutes. As 'order' NVIDIA is the backup: used when the providers above it
 * cannot serve. A weekly probe (the `probeAiProviders` timer, Monday 06:15
 * UTC, lib/timers/ai-provider-probe.js) runs the portal's Test against every
 * provider with a key and records the latency on each provider card, so
 * moving a feature back to 'first' is a choice made on evidence. The Telegram
 * assistant is owner-only chat rather than content, and was 'order' already.
