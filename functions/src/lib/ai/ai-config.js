/**
 * ai-config.js — the admin portal's AI settings, made to actually mean something.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The admin portal has had provider cards with enable toggles
 * and an order field since it was ported. They wrote documents into the
 * `ai_providers` container and **the router never opened that container**.
 * `getActiveAiProvider()` looked at environment variables and nothing else, so
 * every toggle in the UI was decorative: turning Claude off in the portal left
 * Claude serving every request. The portal was not merely out of date, it was
 * actively misleading — it also listed Vertex as enabled (a provider the
 * Function App cannot authenticate) and OpenAI as deprecated (a provider the
 * router calls today).
 *
 * This module is the missing half. It reads that configuration and turns it
 * into three answers the router asks for:
 *
 *   1. Which providers hold a key and     resolveProviderOrder()
 *      are switched on?
 *   2. May this feature call a model?     isFeatureEnabled()
 *   3. Which candidates, in which order?  selection + catalog → select.js
 *      (ADR 0034 slice 3, #858; until then applyFeaturePlacement (#701)
 *      and applyFeatureRoute (ADR 0033), which the loader now migrates
 *      into the selection document in memory — migrate-selection.js)
 *
 * THREE RULES DECIDE EVERY EDGE CASE HERE. They are worth stating plainly
 * because each one is the answer to "what happens when configuration and
 * reality disagree", and getting any of them backwards breaks the site in a way
 * that is hard to see.
 *
 *   A KEY IS AUTHORITATIVE; CONFIGURATION IS ADVISORY. Configuration can
 *   disable a provider that has a key and can reorder the ones that do. It can
 *   never enable a provider whose key is absent. If it could, an administrator
 *   could tick a box and every AI call would start failing at the API with a
 *   401 — configuration must not be able to describe a state the platform
 *   cannot enter.
 *
 *   UNREADABLE CONFIGURATION IS NOT EMPTY CONFIGURATION. If Cosmos is
 *   unreachable, `load()` reports null and the router behaves exactly as it did
 *   before this module existed: environment order, every feature on. A
 *   configuration read failure must never be able to turn the site's AI off.
 *   That is why `load()` distinguishes "I could not read" from "I read, and
 *   everything is disabled" — the second is a legitimate instruction and is
 *   obeyed, the first is an outage and is ignored.
 *
 *   ABSENT MEANS ON. A feature with no stored setting is enabled, because that
 *   is the state the site is in today. A new feature must not arrive switched
 *   off, and an empty container must not read as "all off".
 *
 * The cache exists because this is consulted on every AI call and the answer
 * changes when an administrator clicks something — minutes apart at most, never
 * per request. A stale answer is served in preference to no answer when a
 * refresh fails, for the same reason as the second rule.
