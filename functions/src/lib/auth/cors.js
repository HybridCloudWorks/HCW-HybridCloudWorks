/**
 * CORS for the Cloud Tools / admin API.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * DECISION 7 — CORS lives in code, and the platform `cors` block is removed
 * ===========================================================================
 * Two allowlists is the actual hazard: they drift, and when a request fails you
 * cannot tell which one rejected it. Picking in-code, for three reasons:
 *
 *   1. The platform setting can only allowlist-or-omit. Site-Main's applyCors
 *      (`cloud-tools.js:355-376`) returns 403 on a disallowed origin, turning
 *      an invisible browser-side failure into a server-side signal you can
 *      alert on. Preserve that.
 *   2. The platform list is exact-match and cannot express a localhost port
 *      pattern. The Terraform hardcodes 5173 and 4173 — NARROWER than current
 *      behaviour, so a developer on any other port silently breaks.
 *   3. In-code is testable in the same suite as the authorization rules.
 *
 * `support_credentials = true` must also go from the Terraform: it makes the
 * platform intercept OPTIONS preflights itself, so an in-code preflight would
 * never run. It is wrong on its own merits too — this is a bearer-token API,
 * not a cookie API.
 *
 * LOCALHOST DOES NOT SURVIVE TO PRODUCTION. Site-Main includes it
 * unconditionally (`cloud-tools.js:51-53`) and that is a defect not to port:
 * `http://localhost:5173` in a production allowlist means any page running on
 * a victim's machine — a malicious local dev server, a compromised
 * `npm postinstall`, a rogue Electron app — can make cross-origin calls to
 * production carrying the victim's token. Gated on NODE_ENV here; the
 * production Function App already sets NODE_ENV=production, and a local
 * Functions host does not, so nothing is lost.
 *
 * CORS IS NOT AN AUTHORIZATION CONTROL. It stops browsers, not curl. Every
 * role check and rate limit must hold with no Origin header at all — which is
 * why a missing Origin is allowed through here rather than rejected. Do not
 * "harden" that into requiring the header: it would break non-browser clients
 * and buy nothing.

/**
 * The Static Web App's own hostname — RETAINED DELIBERATELY, not a leftover.
 *
 * This said "TEMPORARY, for Migration-Plan §6 step 2. REMOVE IT when DNS moves
 * (§6 step 5)". DNS moved; hybridcloudworks.com has been live for weeks and the
 * origin is still here — so the comment was describing an intention the code had
 * stopped following, which is worse than either answer. Corrected by #521.
 *
 * It stays because `deploy-azure-frontend.yml` documents the production
 * break-glass as re-pointing or disabling the custom domain, and exercising that
 * escape hatch lands on exactly this hostname. Removing the origin would take
 * the admin portal out of the only documented unserviceable-estate recovery
 * path — and it would be discovered during the incident.
 *
 * It is also not the shape Zero Trust guidance warns about: not a wildcard, and
 * not a dangling domain. The host is bound to a live Static Web App we own, and
 * SWA default hostnames carry a random discriminator so they are not
 * reallocated.
 *
 * REVISIT TRIGGER, a real one this time: remove it when the Static Web App is
 * deleted, or when the break-glass procedure stops depending on the default
 * hostname.
 *
 * It is compiled in rather than supplied through `EXTRA_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, which
 * is what §6 step 2 was originally going to use. On 2026-08-22 that setting was
 * applied correctly — verified in ARM byte-for-byte, 51 characters, single key
 * — and the running app still refused the origin, through a restart, a
 * stop/start, three deploys and about twenty probes. `parseExtraOrigins()` and
 * `createCors()` return `true` for that exact value locally, so the code is not
 * the problem, and `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` reaching the same worker proves app
 * settings do arrive. It is unexplained, and it is TODO.md T-513.
 *
 * Two reasons this is the better home regardless of how T-513 resolves:
 *
 *   1. An allowlist is a security control. In code it is reviewed, diffed and
 *      covered by the tests below. As an app setting it can be changed by
 *      anyone with Contributor, silently, with no test and no reviewer.
 *   2. Deploys are the one propagation path that is demonstrably reliable here
 *      — the function count moved 84 → 96 → 97 across three of them, while the
 *      same app ignored a setting written four different ways.
