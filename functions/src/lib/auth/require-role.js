/**
 * The authorization guard every admin handler must call.
 *
 * Replaces `requireAdminClaims` in `src/lib/auth-middleware.js`, which had two
 * defects in nine lines:
 *
 *   1. `requiredRoles = []` defaulted to an EMPTY array, so the check loop
 *      never executed and the function returned success. Any valid Entra token
 *      in the tenant was an admin. Site-Main defaults to 'viewer' and hard
 *      rejects a token with no admin role (`admin-auth.js:91`, `:107-112`),
 *      with a comment recording that an earlier permissive bridge had been a
 *      privilege-escalation path.
 *   2. `userRoles.includes(role)` is exact-string AND semantics, where the
 *      source is a hierarchy comparison — so `['editor']` DENIED publishers and
 *      super_admins. See roles.js `satisfiesRole`.
 *
 * There is no default here. `requireRole` takes the minimum role as a required
 * argument and throws if it is not a recognised one.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * WHY THIS IS ONE SHARED FUNCTION
 * ===========================================================================
 * `firestore.rules` had a default-deny catch-all — `match /{document=**}` with
 * `allow read, write: if false` — that caught every path the API forgot. Azure
 * has no such backstop, and every Function registration defaults to
 * `authLevel: 'anonymous'`. One handler that forgets the check IS the
 * vulnerability.
 *
 * So the check must be structurally unavoidable rather than copy-pasted: one
 * guard, called by every handler, plus a route-inventory test that enumerates
 * every registration and asserts each is either in an explicit public
 * allowlist or invokes this. That test is the replacement for the catch-all
 * rule, and it is the highest-value test in the port.

 *
 * A 401 ALSO SAYS WHY (#517). Until now every 401 from this API was a bare
 * status code, so the admin portal had to guess: an expired token, a rejected
 * token and a token missing the delegated scope all looked identical, and all
 * got the same interactive re-authentication — which recovers only the first.
 *
 * The RFC 6750 error codes happen to draw exactly the line the client needs:
 *

 *   insufficient_scope  the credential is fine and lacks a permission. Signing
 *                       in again returns an identically-rejected token, so the
 *                       client must NOT retry — it is a configuration problem.
 *   (omitted)           no credential was presented at all. Sign in.
