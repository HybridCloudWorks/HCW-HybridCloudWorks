/**
 * Entra ID token verification.
 *
 * Replaces the verification half of `src/lib/auth-middleware.js`, which had
 * three defects that together were a full admin bypass for any tenant member.
 * Each fix is annotated with the finding it closes.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * DECISION 3 — app registration topology: TWO registrations
 * ===========================================================================
 * A public-client SPA registration, and a separate API registration exposing
 * `api://<api-client-id>`. The API validates `aud` against its OWN identifier.
 *
 * With a single registration, an ID token minted for the SPA carries
 * `aud = <client-id>` — indistinguishable from an access token for the API. So
 * a token the browser was never meant to send to an API is accepted by it.
 * Two registrations make the audience meaningful.
 *
 * `ENTRA_API_AUDIENCE` is therefore REQUIRED and has no default.
 *
 * AMENDED 2026-09-12 (#515). This paragraph described a topology the tenant
 * does not have: `scripts/cutover/01-entra-spa.ps1` put an SPA platform on the
 * API registration, so the hazard above has been live, not hypothetical.
 *
 * It was also wrong about the remedy. This text used to end "and let us
 * additionally reject anything without a `scp`/`roles` claim" — but Entra emits
 * assigned app roles in ID tokens too, so a `roles` check separates nothing.
 * `scp` does, and only `scp`: it appears in delegated access tokens and never
 * in ID tokens. `require-role.js` enforces it in `authenticate()`, which closes
 * the hazard independently of how many registrations exist and keeps working
 * after they are split (#522).
 *
 * So the topology is still worth fixing, for the reason Microsoft actually
 * gives — a public client should not share a service principal with the
 * resource it calls — rather than because the API cannot defend itself.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * DECISION 5 — JWKS must be injectable
 * ===========================================================================
 * `createTokenVerifier()` is a factory, not a module-scope singleton. The
 * previous module built its `jwksClient` at import time against a hardcoded
 * URI, which made it untestable without a live tenant — and retrofitting that
 * after eleven handlers exist means touching all eleven.
 *
 * Tests generate an RSA keypair, serve a local JWKS document, and point the
 * verifier at it. That is the direct analogue of Site-Main's
 * `roleUserContext(role)` emulator helper, and it is the only way to exercise
 * the role hierarchy without a directory.
