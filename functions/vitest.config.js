// Test discovery is Vitest's default, exactly as it was before this file
// existed. The only setting here is coverage, which is collected only when
// asked for (`npm run test:coverage`), so `npm test` in the required
// `functions (azure)` CI job is unchanged. coverage.yml uploads
// coverage/lcov.info to Qlty (#568).
//
// `projectRoot` is the repository root, so lcov.info names files as
// `functions/src/...`. Qlty matches coverage to repository paths, and with
// both packages already repo-relative one upload carries frontend and
// functions together, with no per-file prefix fixing.
//
// `test:coverage` also passes --testTimeout=30000 --hookTimeout=60000.
// route-inventory.test.js imports every function module in one beforeAll, and
// under V8 coverage on a loaded machine that import passed Vitest's 10 s hook
// default locally (2026-09-14), failing the suite with no test at fault. The
// flags are on the coverage script only, so `npm test` keeps the defaults.
