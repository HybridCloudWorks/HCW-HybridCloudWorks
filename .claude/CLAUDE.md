# Working agreements

## Owner-facing instructions must be runnable, not descriptive

When telling the owner what to do next, give **commands they can paste**, not a
description of the goal. Specifically:

- **PowerShell by default.** The owner works at a `PS C:\Users\<you>\...`
  prompt. Write PowerShell: `$x = ...` assignment, no `$(...)` command
  substitution, no backtick line continuations pasted into anything but
  PowerShell.
- **If a command must be bash, say so on the line above it.** The owner also has
  Git Bash (`MINGW64`) open and switches between them. Two commands were lost on
  2026-08-30 to bash syntax pasted at a PowerShell prompt and to PowerShell
  backticks pasted into bash — both because the shell was assumed rather than
  stated.
- **Prefer one line.** A multi-line command is a continuation-character bug
  waiting to happen across two shells. Where a value must carry between
  commands, compute it rather than asking the owner to retype it.
- **Never leave a placeholder in a line meant to be pasted.** Not
  `THEACCOUNTNAME`, not `<your-id>`, not `THE_ADDRESS`. The rule is about
  commands, not about prose: naming a shape in a sentence — the
  `PS C:\Users\<you>\...` prompt above, or the `rg-<tier>-site-prod-cus`
  resource-group convention — describes the estate and is fine. A command is
  different, because it gets pasted exactly as written.

  Every name a command needs here is already known. `infra/variables.tf`
  carries the defaults — `stsiteprodcus01`, `func-site-prod-cus-01`,
  `kv-site-prod-cus-01` — and the resource groups in use are
  `rg-stor-site-prod-cus` (storage), `rg-web-site-prod-cus` (function app),
  `rg-sec-site-prod-cus` (Key Vault) and `rg-mgmt-plat-prod-cus` (Log
  Analytics and the action group, in the Management subscription). Look the
  value up and write it in.

  Twice on 2026-08-30 a placeholder shipped and was pasted verbatim:
  `THE_ADDRESS` produced `EmailAddressIsNotValid`, and `THEACCOUNTNAME`
  produced a DNS failure on `theaccountname.blob.core.windows.net`. Both cost
  a round trip, and in neither case did the error describe the thing being
  tested.
- **Prefer the control-plane `az` verb when one exists.** These two read the
  same container, and only the first works on Reader alone:

  ```powershell
  az storage container-rm show --storage-account stsiteprodcus01 -g rg-stor-site-prod-cus -n listenandlearn -o json | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object name, publicAccess
  ```

  ```powershell
  az storage container show --name listenandlearn --account-name stsiteprodcus01 --auth-mode login -o json | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object name
  ```

  The second is data-plane. It needs a Storage Blob Data role, and it resolves
  `stsiteprodcus01.blob.core.windows.net` — so a wrong account name fails at
  name resolution with `getaddrinfo failed`, before auth or the container is
  ever reached. That is how the `THEACCOUNTNAME` paste above disguised itself
  as a broken container.
- **If a command reads a repository file, say which branch it is on.** A
  command like `az role definition create --role-definition
  '@infra/roles/x.json'` works only if that file exists in the owner's working
  tree. When the file was added on an unmerged branch and the owner is on
  `main`, it does not — and `az` reports **`Failed to parse string as JSON`**
  naming the path, because a value that is neither valid JSON nor an existing
  file falls through to the JSON parser. The error describes the wrong subject
  entirely, which is the expensive kind.

  So pair any such command with the checkout that makes it runnable, or with a
  one-line existence check the owner can read before believing the error:

  ```powershell
  Test-Path infra/roles/static-web-app-deployer.json
  ```

  Cost two round trips on 2026-08-30. The first correction blamed PowerShell's
  splatting operator and prescribed single quotes; quoting was not the problem
  and the quoted form failed identically. Recorded that way because a
  confidently wrong rule in this file is worse than no rule.
- **Avoid `az --query` with brackets.** `[0]` and `[?...]` get re-parsed and
  fail with `] was unexpected at this time`. Use `-o json | ConvertFrom-Json`
  and filter in PowerShell.
- **Anything done in a browser needs the exact URL**, deep-linked to the page
  holding the setting — not "go to Settings and find X".

State what a successful result looks like, so the owner can tell a real failure
from a reporting failure without asking. That distinction has been the expensive
one: on 2026-08-30 the Azure portal reported a test as failed while the email
arrived, and a timer script reported 57,581 invocations where the query returned
two rows.

## Pull requests open ready for review, not as drafts

Owner decision 2026-09-05. Every PR opened from a session was arriving as a
draft, and the owner had to flip each one to ready for review before merging
— a round trip that from a phone is the whole cost of the PR. GitHub has no
repository setting that forces this; it is chosen by whoever creates the PR,
so it is recorded here, where every session reads it.

- **Create the PR ready for review.** Copilot reviews either state, CI runs
  on either state, and nothing in this repository keys on draft.
- **Draft is the exception, and it is stated.** If a PR is opened before its
  own checks have been run locally, or it exists to hold a question rather
  than a change, say so in the first line of the description and open it as
  a draft. Otherwise not.
- **Check for a waiting review before reporting a PR as finished, and again
  whenever the session next touches it.** Owner instruction 2026-09-10, after
  a session opened a PR, watched CI go green, reported it done, and stopped —
  while a Copilot review carrying two security findings sat on it unread. CI
  passing is not the end of a PR; the review is. Green checks and an unread
  review look identical from the outside, which is why this is a step rather
  than a habit.

  The verdict and the inline findings live in two different places and a
  session needs both — the review body carries the verdict, and the line
  comments carry what to actually fix. **The four below are bash (Git Bash),
  not PowerShell** — the same rule as the top of this file, which applies to
  a session's own commands as much as to the owner's:

  ```bash
  PR=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)
  gh pr view "$PR" --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid
  gh api repos/HybridCloudWorks/HCW-HybridCloudWorks/pulls/"$PR"/reviews --paginate --jq '.[] | select(.user.login=="copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]") | "\(.commit_id[0:8]) \(.state) \((.body // "") | split("\n")[0])"'
  gh api repos/HybridCloudWorks/HCW-HybridCloudWorks/pulls/"$PR"/comments --paginate --jq '.[] | "\(.path):line \(.line // .original_line // "unknown")\n\(.body)\n"'
  ```

  Every detail in those lines is a mistake someone has already made. Stated
  without a count on purpose: this file learned from T-722 that a number
  above a list drifts the moment the list grows, and this very sentence said
  "three" over four bullets until review caught it.

  - **The reviews line prints the commit a review judged**, and the line
    above prints the head, because only a review of the head is the merge
    signal below. A review looks the same whether it read the current code
    or three pushes ago, and the sha is the only thing that says which.
  - **`--paginate`, because `gh api` stops at thirty.** A PR with more
    review comments than that silently returns a prefix, and a section whose
    whole point is finding every outstanding item cannot end at an arbitrary
    cut. The same default truncated a board listing to its first thirty rows
    on 2026-09-10 and made four open issues look absent.
  - **A comment on an outdated line still knows where it was.** `.line` goes
    null once the code beneath a comment has moved, but `.original_line`
    survives, so falling back to it keeps a finding locatable instead of
    printing a shrug. Only a comment with neither is genuinely unplaced.
  - **The bot login differs between the two APIs.** REST spells it
    `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]`; `gh pr view --json reviews` spells
    the same actor `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`, with no suffix. A filter
    written for one and run against the other matches nothing and reads
    exactly like "no reviews yet".

  Then work the loop: fix every recommendation, push, reply on each thread
  naming the commit, resolve it, and ask for another review of the new head.
  Repeat until the review of the current head recommends approval, which is
  the merge signal below. A finding judged wrong is answered on its thread
  with the reason rather than silently skipped — disagreeing is allowed,
  ignoring is not.

  **Copilot is one teammate wearing two hats, and `@copilot review` can bring
  back either.** It reviews as `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` and it commits
  as `copilot-swe-agent`, and a request for a review may come back as a
  review, as a fix pushed straight to the branch, or as both. That is the
  service working, not a surprise to be audited.

  Owner instruction 2026-09-10, after a session described two perfectly good
  commits from the agent as "not asked for" and made a small ceremony of
  vetting them:

  - **When the agent fixes the finding, that is the finding closed.** Take it
    as the only thing that was wrong, reply on the thread acknowledging the
    fix and naming its commit, resolve, and treat the change as the precursor
    to a green head. The acknowledgement is that reply and the resolve —
    there is no commit to make for it, since the agent's own push is already
    the change. Once it is posted and the review of that head recommends
    approval, merge. Do not re-derive the fix, re-review it line by line, or
    hold the PR open to prove it was read.
  - **When the fix does not actually close the finding, say so and correct
    it.** Push the correction, explain on the thread what was still open, and
    ask for another review. That is the same loop as any other round.
  - **Disagreement is welcome; suspicion is not.** A finding judged wrong, or
    a fix judged incomplete, gets a reason on the thread and a counter-
    proposal. What it does not get is silence, or a reply that reads as
    guarding the branch against a colleague.

  A plain push also triggers a fresh review on its own, so the comment is
  rarely needed to get one.
- **A Copilot review that recommends approval is the owner's "merge".** Owner
  decision 2026-09-05: Copilot code review has authority to approve PRs in
  this repository, so when its review of the **current head** recommends
  approval, a session merges without waiting for the owner to say so —
  provided every status check the repository ruleset requires is green on
  that head and no review thread is unresolved. Read the verdict, not the
  wording: Copilot's approval line has changed before (in this repository it
  has read `This pull request is ready to be approved.`), so key on a review
  that recommends approval, never on an exact string. A review that
  recommends changes, or any review thread still unresolved on the head, is
  not that: fix, push, and wait for the next review of the new head. Ready
  for review on its own is still not permission to merge.
- **Every review conversation is resolved before the merge, including the
  ones that ask for nothing.** Owner instruction 2026-09-06, after a merge
  was blocked with `A conversation must be resolved before this pull request
  can be merged` on a thread that was a validation note rather than a change
  request. The repository ruleset requires conversation resolution, so an
  open thread of any kind blocks the merge button the same way a failing
  check does. The session that owns the PR resolves each thread once it has
  acted on it: a change request gets the fix pushed and a one-line reply
  naming the commit; a question gets the answer; a validation or
  informational comment gets a reply saying it was read and, if it asked
  for nothing, that nothing changed. Resolve through the API
  (`resolveReviewThread`) after the reply, never before it — an unexplained
  resolution reads as dismissal to the next reviewer. Never resolve a thread
  to get past it: a thread whose ask has not been met stays open and the PR
  waits.

## Several PRs at once, but conflicts are resolved one at a time

Owner instruction 2026-09-10. Working more than one PR in a session is fine
and often faster. What is not fine is carrying two of them into the same
lines at once, because the second conflict is always worse than the first:
it lands on a file that has already been hand-merged, so the resolution has
to be re-derived rather than repeated.

- **Work them in parallel until they touch.** Independent PRs — different
  directories, different files — proceed together with no special handling.
- **The moment two open PRs would edit the same lines, stop one.** Finish the
  first through to merge, then fix the conflict on the next, then the next.
  One at a time, in a decided order, rather than all of them at once against
  a base that keeps moving.
- **`CHANGELOG.md` is the file this happens on.** Nearly every PR appends to
  the same `[Unreleased]` section, so two PRs open together will collide
  there even when they share no code. Treat a second changelog entry as the
  signal to serialise, not as a surprise when the merge button goes red.
- **Rebases follow the same rule: complete one, then rebase the next onto
  it.** Rebasing every open branch onto a new `main` at once means resolving
  the same upstream change several times over, once per branch, with no way
  to reuse the answer. Land one, rebase the next onto the result, land it,
  and continue. A branch waiting its turn is cheaper than a branch rebased
  twice.
