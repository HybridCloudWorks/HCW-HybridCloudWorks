/**
 * worker.js — the reachability probe that runs where Bot Fight Mode cannot
 * see it (ADR 0024, T-519).
 *
 * Azure's availability agents are datacenter clients, and Cloudflare's free
 * Bot Fight Mode answers datacenter clients asking for
 * https://api-azure.<domain>/api/health with a 403 interstitial. A WAF skip
 * rule against it was built, applied and confirmed inert, because Bot Fight
 * Mode does not run on the Ruleset Engine (REVIEW.md, *Timers and the
 * availability test*). So the standard web test in infra/observability.tf
 * cannot be armed, and the one signal that survives the app being completely
 * down — reachability — has no alert behind it.
 *
 * This Worker is the alternative: a cron-triggered probe running on
 * Cloudflare itself. A subrequest from a same-account Worker to its own zone
 * is not challenged by Bot Fight Mode; it enters the zone's pipeline (so the
 * origin-secret transform rule stamps it like any visitor request) and
 * reaches the origin from Cloudflare's own egress ranges (so the Function
 * App's ip_restriction Deny admits it). What it exercises is the edge → WAF →
 * transform → origin path — everything a browser's request traverses except
 * the client-to-edge leg, which is Cloudflare's availability, not ours.
 *
 * The result is reported as AvailabilityData to Application Insights, so the
 * probe lands in the same `availabilityResults` table the retired standard
 * web test would have written and the alert on it lives in the same fabric as
 * every other rule (infra/observability.tf, `edge_probe_availability`). The
 * alert fires on MISSING successes, not on present failures, so a dead
 * Worker, a dead cron, and a dead ingestion path all look like the outage
 * they are indistinguishable from.
 *
 * Failure handling is deliberately one-sided: a probe that cannot reach the
 * API still reports (success=false, with the status or error text as the
 * message); a probe that cannot reach the App Insights ingestion endpoint
 * reports nothing, and the absence fires the alert. Retrying ingestion from
 * here would only delay that signal.
 *
 * PROBE_NAME must match the name the Terraform alert queries for —
 * infra/observability.tf and wrangler.toml each carry a comment pointing at
 * the other.
