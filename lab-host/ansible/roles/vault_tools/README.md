# vault_tools

The host side of the Ansible vault: the directory `bootstrap.sh` reads it
from, and `hcw-vault-set`, which sets one key in it. This is the vault the
playbook reads, `/etc/hcw/ansible/vault.yml`. HashiCorp Vault, which the
host also runs, is the `vault` role.

`hcw-vault-set` was first installed on the host by hand. This role puts the
same helper there from the repository, with two fixes (below), so the host
carries no hand-made tooling.

## What it does

1. Makes `/etc/hcw/ansible` a directory, `root:root` `0700`. That is what the
   `install -d` line in `lab-host/README.md` ("The vault") makes, so on a
   host where the owner ran it this task is `ok`. The role creates neither
   `vault.yml` nor `vault-password`.
2. Copies `files/hcw-vault-set` to `/usr/local/sbin/hcw-vault-set`,
   `root:root` `0750`.

It runs straight after `hardening` in `site.yml`, so the helper is in place
even when a later role stops on a missing vault key, which is when it is
needed.

## hcw-vault-set

```text
hcw-vault-set KEY   (the value is read from stdin)
```

The owner's line, from the workstation, is in `lab-host/README.md`, "The
vault". On the host, as root:

1. It refuses a key that is not `vault_` followed by `[a-z0-9_]`, with exit
   code 2, before reading anything.
2. It refuses, with exit code 2 and before reading the value, a key the
   playbook itself defines as a variable. `bootstrap.sh` passes `vault.yml`
   with `-e`, and an extra var outranks every other variable, so such a key
   would silently replace it: `vault_enabled` or `vault_api_port`, say,
   which belong to the `vault` role that runs HashiCorp Vault. The names
   are read at run time from the checkout the host runs, `/opt/hcw-src`
   (`HCW_SRC_DIR` overrides it, which is how the test runs it): every
   top-level variable of `lab-host/ansible/group_vars/all.yml` and of each
   role's `defaults/main.yml` and `vars/main.yml`, and every name a role's
   task registers or sets with `set_fact`, including inside blocks. The
   error names the file. With no checkout there, or a file in it that does
   not parse, it refuses every key rather than guess. None of the keys the
   playbook reads from the vault today is refused.
3. It refuses with exit code 2 when `vault-password` is missing or empty.
4. It reads the value from stdin into a root-only temporary directory,
   dropping carriage returns. A leading byte order mark and surrounding
   whitespace are removed too, and an empty value is refused.
5. It decrypts `vault.yml` when it exists, sets the key in the parsed
   mapping and writes it back as YAML (sorted keys; comments are not kept).
   Every value it writes is a string, so `true` or `0123` stays the text it
   was.
6. It encrypts the result with the existing password, then decrypts it
   again to check the key is there.
7. It installs the result beside `vault.yml` as `root:root` `0600` and
   renames it over `vault.yml`.
8. It prints `hcw-vault-set: set KEY (value not shown). Keys in the vault:`
   followed by the key names. The temporary files are shredded on every
   exit.

Nothing it prints contains a value, and the value is never an argument, so
it is not in `ps`, a shell history or a log. `HCW_VAULT_DIR` points it at
another directory and `HCW_SRC_DIR` at another checkout, which is how the
test runs it. `sudo` resets the environment, so through the owner's line
they are always `/etc/hcw/ansible` and `/opt/hcw-src`.

### What changed from the hand-installed copy

- **The vault is replaced by rename.** The hand-installed copy ended with
  `install -m 0600 -o root -g root "$tmp/new" "$vault"`. On Ubuntu 26.04 that
  `install` (uutils coreutils 0.8.0) unlinks `vault.yml` first, then creates
  and writes the new file (seen with `strace`: `unlink`, then `openat(...,
  O_CREAT|O_EXCL)`). A run that stopped between the two, for example on a
  full disk, left no vault at all. The file is now installed as
  `.vault.yml.hcw-vault-set.<pid>` in the same directory and moved over
  `vault.yml` with `mv -f`, which is one `renameat`. The temporary name is
  removed on any exit, and it is not the `.vault.yml.next` that
  `scripts/lab/Register-LabAgent.ps1` uses, so the two writers never rename
  each other's half-written file.
- **A leading byte order mark is not part of the value.** The value was read
  as `utf-8`, and `str.strip()` does not remove U+FEFF. A value piped from a
  Windows tool that prepends one reached the vault with it, and a secret
  with an invisible first character fails wherever it is used, far from
  here. It is read as `utf-8-sig` now. The test pipes `EF BB BF` before a
  value, and the hand-installed copy fails that check.

Everything else is byte for byte the hand-installed copy, so the first run
after this role lands reports its copy task `changed` and every run after
that `ok`.

### Since then

- **Names the playbook defines are refused** (step 2 above; 2026-09-28,
  with the lab launcher). Until then the helper took any `vault_*` name,
  and this README and `lab-host/README.md` could only ask the owner never
  to set `vault_enabled` and its kind. The run after it lands reports the
  copy task `changed` once more.

## Tests

`tests/hcw-vault-set.test.sh` runs `files/hcw-vault-set` as it ships, as
root, against a scratch `HCW_VAULT_DIR` and a real `ansible-vault`. It
checks:

- the helper's two tool paths are where `bootstrap.sh` installs them, and
  its checkout is where `bootstrap.sh` keeps it;
- bad key names are refused (exit 2) and create nothing;
- `vault_enabled` is refused against this repository's own playbook, and
  every key the playbook reads from the vault passes;
- in a checkout made for the test, a name in `group_vars/all.yml`, a role's
  `defaults/main.yml` or `vars/main.yml`, a task's `register` inside a block
  and a `set_fact` are each refused with the file named, another name
  passes, and a file that does not parse or a missing checkout refuses
  every key;
- empty values are refused, before and after the vault exists;
- a missing password and a wrong one are refused;
- two keys can be set and one replaced, with CR, LF, BOM and spaces
  removed;
- YAML-looking values come back as the same strings;
- a key the helper did not write is kept;
- the file is Ansible Vault ciphertext, holds no value in the clear, and is
  `root:root` `0600`;
- every refused run leaves `vault.yml` byte for byte as it was;
- no temporary file is left behind.

The `ansible-lint (lab-host)` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs it with
`sudo` and the job's own ansible-core. Where `/usr/local/bin/ansible-vault`
or `/opt/uv/tools/ansible-core/bin/python` is missing, the test links it to
the `ansible-vault` on `PATH` and the Python that runs it, and removes those
links at the end. It never replaces a file that is there. To run it without
a host, see `lab-host/README.md`, "Validating without a host".

## Variables

None. `files/hcw-vault-set` names `/etc/hcw/ansible` and `/opt/hcw-src`
itself (the second is `bootstrap.sh`'s `HCW_SRC_DIR` default, which the
test holds it to), and the documentation and the owner's one-liners name
`/usr/local/sbin/hcw-vault-set`, so no path can move alone.
`meta/argument_specs.yml` says so.

## Check mode

Safe: both tasks are `file` and `copy`.
