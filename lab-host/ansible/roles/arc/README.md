# arc

Onboards the lab host to Azure Arc (ADR 0032 decision 3, #663): the Azure
Connected Machine agent from Microsoft's apt repository at a pinned version,
connected to `rg-lab-hybrid-prod-cus` by a service principal that holds only
**Azure Connected Machine Onboarding** on that group (`infra/lab-hybrid.tf`).
It runs straight after `hardening` in `site.yml`, because the agent needs
nothing the later roles install and the host should appear in Azure even when
a later role fails.

Off until the host says otherwise: `arc_enabled` in `group_vars/all.yml` reads
the local fact `/etc/ansible/facts.d/hcw_arc.fact` and is true only when that
file is JSON whose `enabled` is `true`. Nothing in the repository sets it;
`scripts/lab/Register-LabArc.ps1 -Connect` writes it once the onboarding
grant is applied and the credential is in the vault, so a rebuilt host, which
has no such file, never stops at this role's fail-closed check on its first
run. The owner's procedure, two runs of that script with one `hcw-azure` run
between them, is
[docs/runbooks/labs-host.md](../../../../docs/runbooks/labs-host.md), "Arc
onboarding".

## What it does

With `arc_enabled: false`, nothing. It does not install the agent, and it
does not disconnect a machine that is already connected: disconnecting
deletes the Azure resource, so it is a runbook step, never the side effect of
a switch.

With `arc_enabled: true`:

1. Asserts no `arc_tags` name or value contains a comma, an equals sign or a
   space, because `azcmagent` takes them as `Name=Value,Name=Value`.
2. Fetches the key that signs the running release's Microsoft repository to
   `/etc/apt/keyrings/microsoft.asc`, refusing it unless its SHA256 matches
   `arc_apt_key_checksum` (the key is the root of trust for the version pin),
   and adds `https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/<version>/prod`, suite
   `<codename>`, as a deb822 source with `Signed-By`. Microsoft signs the two
   repositories with different keys, so both the key and its checksum are
   chosen by codename:

   | Release | Repository | Key | Fingerprint |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | 26.04 `resolute` | `https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/26.04/prod` | `microsoft-2025.asc` | `AA86F75E427A19DD33346403EE4D7792F748182B` |
   | 24.04 `noble` | `https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/24.04/prod` | `microsoft.asc` | `BC528686B50D79E339D3721CEB3E94ADBE1229CF` |

   <https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/README> is Microsoft's account of
   why: repositories created since spring 2025 are signed with the newer
   key. `microsoft.asc` cannot verify the 26.04 repository's `InRelease`
   at all.
3. Installs `azcmagent` at `arc_agent_version` and holds it, the same pattern
   as the `docker` role; `allow_change_held_packages` lets a pin bump move it.
   The package drops `/etc/cron.d/azcmagent_autoupgrade`, which does nothing
   unless automatic upgrade is enabled, and this role never enables it: the
   version moves when the pin moves.
4. Reads `azcmagent show --json`. When `status` is `Connected` it stops
   there, and the vault values are not needed, which is what lets the
   runbook delete the secret after onboarding (ADR 0032: the credential is
   never on the host after onboarding).
5. Otherwise it fails closed unless all four `vault_arc_*` values are
   present and the application, tenant and subscription ids are GUIDs, then
   writes them with the target group, region, resource name and tags into a
   root-only `0600` temporary file and runs `azcmagent connect --config
   <file>`. The secret is never on a command line, where it would sit in the
   process table; the file is deleted in an `always:` whether connect
   succeeds or not. Microsoft recommends `--config` over
   `--service-principal-secret` for exactly this reason.
6. Reads `azcmagent show --json` again and fails unless it reports
   `Connected`. The success line reads `Connected to Azure Arc as
   arcs-lab-hybrid-prod-cus-01 in rg-lab-hybrid-prod-cus.`
7. Locks the agent down (estate review 2026-10-06, LAB-6; ADR 0032,
   amendments of 2026-10-06 and 2026-10-07): the extension allowlist is
   `arc_extensions_allowlist` alone (the Azure Monitor Agent), incoming
   connections through Arc are off, and guest configuration is off. Each
   setting is read with `azcmagent config get` and written with `config
   set` only when it differs, so a second run reports nothing changed.
   These settings live on the host and cannot be changed from Azure, which
   is the point: a Contributor on the resource group can no longer push an
   extension or a Run Command, and a custom machine configuration policy
   cannot rewrite them. Read back on the host with `sudo
   /opt/azcmagent/bin/azcmagent config list`.

What it does **not** do: install the Azure Monitor Agent, or associate the
data collection rule. Both are Azure-side operations on the machine resource,
which exists only after step 5, and the onboarding role cannot install an
extension. `Register-LabArc.ps1 -Connect` does both once the machine is
Connected, and then deletes the credential from Entra and the vault.

## Variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `arc_enabled` | required (`group_vars`: the host's `hcw_arc` local fact, false without it) | Onboard the host |
| `arc_agent_version` | required | apt version of `azcmagent`, four-part |
| `arc_apt_key_checksum` | required | `sha256:<hex>` the fetched key must match; `group_vars` picks it from `arc_apt_key_checksums` by codename |
| `arc_resource_group` | required | `rg-lab-hybrid-prod-cus` |
| `arc_location` | required | `centralus` |
| `arc_resource_name` | required | `arcs-lab-hybrid-prod-cus-01`; fixed, because it cannot change without a disconnect |
| `arc_tags` | required | Tags on the machine resource; `infra/`'s tag set with `managedBy: ansible` |
| `arc_apt_key_urls` | `resolute`: `microsoft-2025.asc`, `noble`: `microsoft.asc` | Codename to signing key source |
| `arc_apt_key_url` | the running release's entry of `arc_apt_key_urls` | Signing key source |
| `arc_apt_key_path` | `/etc/apt/keyrings/microsoft.asc` | Signing key location, whichever key it is; `get_url` replaces a file whose checksum does not match |
| `arc_apt_repository_url` | `https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/<running version>/prod` | Repository base |
| `arc_azcmagent_path` | `/opt/azcmagent/bin/azcmagent` | The CLI |
| `arc_cloud` | `AzureCloud` | Azure cloud |
| `arc_service_principal_id` | `vault_arc_service_principal_id` | Application (client) id of the onboarding principal |
| `arc_service_principal_secret` | `vault_arc_service_principal_secret` | Its client secret |
| `arc_tenant_id` | `vault_arc_tenant_id` | Entra tenant id |
| `arc_subscription_id` | `vault_arc_subscription_id` | Application subscription id |

To bump the agent, read the versions the repository offers and change
`arc_agent_version` in `group_vars/all.yml`. It is one pin because
Microsoft publishes the same version string to both releases' repositories
(1.68.03532.1399 was the newest in each on 2026-09-26); check both before
moving it. Bash, from anywhere with network access; the last line each
prints is the newest, 26.04 first:

```bash
curl -s https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/26.04/prod/dists/resolute/main/binary-amd64/Packages | awk '/^Package: azcmagent$/{p=1} p&&/^Version:/{print $2; p=0}' | sort -V | tail -3
```

```bash
curl -s https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/24.04/prod/dists/noble/main/binary-amd64/Packages | awk '/^Package: azcmagent$/{p=1} p&&/^Version:/{print $2; p=0}' | sort -V | tail -3
```

The key checksums, bash; the first is the `resolute` entry of
`arc_apt_key_checksums`, the second the `noble` entry:

```bash
curl -sL https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft-2025.asc | sha256sum
```

```bash
curl -sL https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sha256sum
```

Microsoft Learn lists Ubuntu 26.04 as supported for Arc-enabled servers on
x86-64 (not Arm64), and Ubuntu 26.04 LTS as supported by the Azure Monitor
Agent, both read 2026-09-26:
<https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/servers/prerequisites#supported-operating-systems>
and
<https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-supported-operating-systems>.

Microsoft supports agent versions released in the last year, so a pin older
than that is a finding.

## Handlers

None. The agent's services are started by its package and by `connect`.

## Check mode

Safe. The status read runs in check mode because it is read-only; connect
and the temporary file are skipped, and so are the lockdown reads and writes
in step 7.

## Validated

On 2026-09-26, against a systemd Ubuntu 26.04 container (and again on
24.04): the role fetched `microsoft-2025.asc` on 26.04 and `microsoft.asc` on
24.04, each matching its pinned checksum; apt accepted the 26.04
repository's `InRelease` with the 2025 key; `azcmagent 1.68.03532.1399`
installed and held on both; `azcmagent show --json` returned
`Disconnected`; the role failed closed on the missing vault values; and a
second run reported every install task unchanged (`changed=0`).

On 2026-09-25, against a systemd Ubuntu 24.04 container: the key checksum
matched, `azcmagent 1.68.03532.1399` installed and held, a second run
reported the install tasks unchanged, `azcmagent show --json` returned
`Disconnected`, the role failed closed with the vault absent, and with
placeholder GUIDs `connect` read the `--config` file (it named the tenant
from it in the error) and the file was gone afterwards.
