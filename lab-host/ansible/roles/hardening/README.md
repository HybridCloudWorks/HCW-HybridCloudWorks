# hardening

The first role `site.yml` runs. It replaces the "Harden the Hostinger VPS" step
the admin Labs page's Setup tab used to ask the owner to do by hand.

## What it does

1. Installs the packages it configures, `sudo` included: a minimal image may
   not ship it, and both the administrative user's access and the play's own
   `become` depend on it (`bootstrap.sh` installs it too, before Ansible
   ever runs, for the same reason). Creates `hcwadmin` with passwordless
   sudo (`/etc/sudoers.d/90-hcw-admin`, validated with `visudo`) and
   installs its public keys. With
   `hardening_admin_authorized_keys` empty the keys are copied from
   `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`, which is where the Hostinger provisioner
   puts the key Terraform passes it. The role **refuses to continue** if no
   key is found from either source, because the next step would lock the
   host.
2. Writes `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/00-hcw-hardening.conf` with
   `PasswordAuthentication no`, `PermitRootLogin no` and
   `KbdInteractiveAuthentication no`, validated with `sshd -t`. The `00-`
   prefix matters: sshd keeps the first value it reads and Ubuntu's cloud
   image ships `50-cloud-init.conf` with `PasswordAuthentication yes`.
3. ufw: default deny inbound, allow outbound, allow TCP 22, 80, 443.
   Docker's iptables rules for a published port come before ufw's, so ufw
   cannot close a port Docker publishes. That is why every publish on this
   host names the loopback: Coder's `127.0.0.1:7080` in its Compose file and
   Portainer's `127.0.0.1:9443`, which the `portainer` role refuses to move.
   Jobs run with `--network none`, and Caddy binds 80 and 443 directly.
4. `unattended-upgrades` with `Automatic-Reboot` at
   `hardening_unattended_reboot_time`.
5. A fail2ban `sshd` jail on the systemd backend, which reads sshd's
   journal directly, so the jail works on 26.04 and 24.04 whether or not
   rsyslog is installed to write `/var/log/auth.log`.

## Variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hardening_admin_user` | `hcwadmin` | The key-only administrative login |
| `hardening_admin_authorized_keys` | `[]` | Public keys; empty copies root's |
| `hardening_ufw_allowed_tcp_ports` | `[22, 80, 443]` | Inbound TCP allowlist |
| `hardening_ufw_logging` | `low` | ufw logging level |
| `hardening_unattended_reboot_time` | `04:30` | Reboot hour for unattended upgrades |
| `hardening_fail2ban_maxretry` | `5` | Failures before a ban |
| `hardening_fail2ban_findtime` | `10m` | Counting window |
| `hardening_fail2ban_bantime` | `1h` | Ban length |
| `hardening_held_report_tag` | `hcw-held-upgradable` | Syslog tag of the held-package report |
| `hardening_held_report_script_path` | `/usr/local/sbin/hcw-held-upgradable` | Where the report script is installed |
| `hardening_held_report_on_calendar` | `*-*-* 07:15:00` | When the report runs (systemd `OnCalendar`) |

`meta/argument_specs.yml` is the contract; the table is a summary of it.

6. `hcw-unit-failed@.service`, a template unit the other roles name in
   `OnFailure=` on the units that matter (the Coder backup, the labs agent,
   Caddy, Vault). When one of them enters the failed state it logs one line
   at `daemon.err`, which the Arc data collection rule ships and
   `alert-lab-unit-failed` pages on (LAB-2, 2026-10-06).
7. `hcw-held-upgradable`, a daily timer (LAB-3, #949). The docker,
   labs_agent and arc roles hold their packages so that unattended-upgrades
   cannot move them, which also means nothing on the host said when a fix
   for one was waiting. Once a day, after the unattended-upgrades reboot
   window, the script reads `apt-mark showhold` and `apt list --upgradable`
   and logs, under the tag `hcw-held-upgradable`:

   - one line per held package apt could upgrade, at `daemon.warning`,
     which the Arc data collection rule ships to Log Analytics:
     `held package containerd.io is upgradable: installed <version>,
     candidate <version>. ...`;
   - otherwise one line at `daemon.notice`, which stays on the host:
     `no held package is upgradable: 5 held (...); package lists from
     <time>`.

   It reads the lists `apt-daily.timer` refreshes and changes nothing, so it
   never takes apt's locks; it runs as a dynamic user. A failed run is a
   line from the failure notifier above (`OnFailure=`). On the host, bash:
   `journalctl -t hcw-held-upgradable --since -2d` shows the last two days,
   and `sudo systemctl start hcw-held-upgradable.service` runs it now. What
   to do about a warning line is `docs/runbooks/labs-host.md`, "Runtime
   advisories".

## Handlers

`Restart ssh`, `Restart unattended-upgrades`, `Restart fail2ban`, `Reload
systemd for the failure notifier`, `Reload systemd for the held-package
report`.

## Tests

`tests/hcw-held-upgradable.test.sh` renders the report script and its two
units with the role's defaults and runs the script against stub `apt-mark`,
`apt` and `logger`: one warning line per held package with an upgrade and
none for a package that is not held, the notice line when nothing is
upgradable, and a non-zero exit when apt fails. It needs neither root nor
Docker; CI runs it in the `ansible-lint (lab-host)` job, and
`lab-host/README.md` ("Validating without a host") has the container line.

## Check mode

Safe. Every task is a module with check-mode support; `sshd -t` and `visudo -cf`
run against the rendered temporary file, not the live one.
