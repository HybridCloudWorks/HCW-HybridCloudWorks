# Tests ../templates/hcw-held-upgradable.sh.j2, the daily held-package report
# this role renders to /usr/local/sbin/hcw-held-upgradable (LAB-3, #949), by
# rendering it and its service and timer with the role's own defaults and
# running the script against stub `apt-mark`, `apt` and `logger` on PATH.
# The stubs answer from files in a scratch directory and the logger stub
# records each line it is asked to send, with its tag and priority.
#
# No root and no Docker needed. CI runs it in the `ansible-lint (lab-host)`
# job with the job's Python, which has Jinja2 and PyYAML from ansible-core;
# lab-host/README.md ("Validating without a host") has the container line.
