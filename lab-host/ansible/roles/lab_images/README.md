# lab_images

Holds every digest-pinned lab image on the host before a job needs it, and
removes the digests no pin names any more. It runs straight after
`labs_agent` in `site.yml`, because the plan runs on the Node.js that role
installs and reads the checkout it makes.

## Why

The first public "Validate on the lab" job on the live host, on 2026-09-28,
spent its opening seconds pulling the `hcw-lab-runner` image (about 320 MB):
the visitor waited for a first-time download and the job log filled with
pull lines. `docker run` pulls a missing image implicitly, and the runner's
timeout (`timeoutSeconds` plus a 15-second grace, `lib/docker-runner.js`)
covers that pull too. Every image is pinned by digest in the repository, so
the host can hold them before any job asks.

## What it does

1. **Reads the pins, never a copy of them.** `files/lab-images.mjs` runs on
   the host's `node` and, for each checkout in `lab_images_checkouts`,
   imports `vps-agent/lib/capabilities.js` and takes every value of
   `IMAGES`, so Node itself parses the file and whatever the module exports
   is what the host holds. It also reads the Coder workspace image,
   `local.image` in `lab-host/coder/templates/hcw-lab/main.tf`, from its
   `image` and `image_digest` locals. A pin bump in either file reaches the
   host on the next `bootstrap.sh` run with no edit here.
   `scripts/lab-images.test.mjs` holds the helper to both files as they are
   in the repository, so a change of shape that the helper cannot read fails
   CI rather than the host.
2. **Refuses a pin that is not a digest.** Every pin must be
   `name[:tag]@sha256:<64 hex>`; anything else fails the play at the plan
   step, naming the entry (`IMAGES.alpine in .../capabilities.js is ...`).
3. **Pulls by `repository@digest`**, with
   `community.docker.docker_image_pull` and `pull: not_present`: every
   capability image, and the workspace image while
   `lab_images_pull_workspace` is true (it defaults to `coder_enabled`). A
   digest already on the host is `ok`, with no registry call. The tag is
   dropped from the pull because Docker ignores the tag of a reference that
   carries a digest, and because the module splits `name:tag@digest` at the
   `@` and then looks for a repository literally named `name:tag`, so the
   tagged form would pull on every run. A pull that fails fails the play
   with the image as the item label.
4. **Removes what no pin names**, in the lab's own repositories only: the
   repositories the pins name (today `alpine`,
   `ghcr.io/hybridcloudworks/hcw-lab-runner` and
   `ghcr.io/hybridcloudworks/hcw-lab`) and anything else under
   `ghcr.io/hybridcloudworks/hcw-lab*`. An image is removed when none of its
   references is a pin: each of its references in those repositories goes,
   tags before digests, with `docker image rm`. A reference in any other
   repository is never listed, so an image that also carries one keeps its
   data, and no image outside those repositories is touched. The pinned
   workspace image is kept while Coder is off, because it is still a pin.
5. **Keeps an image a container still uses**, running or stopped (a job in
   flight on the old digest, a Coder workspace on an older template
   version), and prints which container holds it. The next run removes it.

The removal is the Docker CLI rather than a module because community.docker
5.3.0's `docker_image_remove` and `docker_image` rebuild a digest reference
as `name:sha256:...`, which Docker 29.8 refuses with `invalid reference
format`, and removing by image id would also drop references in other
repositories. The plan lists only references Docker reported a moment
before, so each removal is a real change; one that has vanished since
(`No such image`) or that a container started on since (`is using its
referenced image`) is left for the next run instead of failing this one.

## Two checkouts

`lab_images_checkouts` defaults to the playbook's own checkout
(`/opt/hcw-src`) and the agent's (`labs_agent_home`, `/opt/hcw-labs-agent`).
They are the same commit on every plain run. While `-e
labs_agent_repo_ref=<sha>` holds the agent at another commit
(`lab-host/README.md`, "Re-running"), both commits' pins are pulled and
kept, so the held agent keeps its images; the next plain run returns the
agent to the playbook's commit and removes what only the hold needed.

## Does the runner use a present image without a registry call?

Yes. `buildDockerArgs` in `vps-agent/lib/docker-runner.js` passes no
`--pull`, so `docker run` takes Docker's default, `--pull=missing`, and a
digest reference already on the host runs without contacting the registry.
The runner names the image exactly as `IMAGES` writes it
(`name:tag@sha256:...`), and Docker resolves that by the digest, which is
the reference this role pulled. The container run for this role checked it
with the test host's network cut off (`CHANGELOG.md`).

## Check mode

Safe. The Docker listing and the plan are read-only and run in check mode;
`docker_image_pull` reports what it would pull without pulling, and the
removal, a command, is skipped. Check mode reads the playbook's checkout at
the commit the run would apply, so a bumped pin shows as a pull. It cannot
show the removal of the digest that pin replaces while the agent's checkout
is still at the old commit, because that checkout still pins it; the real
run moves the checkout first and then removes it.

## Variables

`lab_images_checkouts`, `lab_images_pull_workspace` and `lab_images_node`,
in `defaults/main.yml`; `meta/argument_specs.yml` is the contract. Nothing
here is a pin: the pins are the two files above.
