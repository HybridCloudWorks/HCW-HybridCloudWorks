"""Copy a Docker named volume's data into the user-namespaced data root.

Installed by the docker role as /usr/local/libexec/hcw-docker-volume-carry
and run by it once per volume, on the run that turns userns-remap on (LAB-5,
2026-10-07). With userns-remap the daemon keeps its objects under
/var/lib/docker/<uid>.<gid> and no longer sees /var/lib/docker/volumes, so a
volume that holds state (Coder's PostgreSQL cluster, Portainer's database)
would come back empty. This copies the old data into the new, empty volume of
the same name.

A remapped container's uid N is the remapped range's first uid plus N on the
host, so data a remapped container will own is shifted by that base
(--uid-shift, --gid-shift). Data a container opted out of the remap for
(--userns=host, which Portainer uses to reach the socket) keeps its owners
(shifts of 0).

Copy, never move: the source is only read. The copy is made beside the
destination and renamed into place, so an interrupted run leaves either the
empty volume or the finished copy, never half of one. It refuses, changing
nothing, when the destination already holds anything, because then a
container has started on it and the data there is not this copy's to replace.

    hcw-docker-volume-carry --from SRC --to DST --uid-shift N --gid-shift N

Exits 0 with one summary line on stdout, non-zero with the reason on stderr.
