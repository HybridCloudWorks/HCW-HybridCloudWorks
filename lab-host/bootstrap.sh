# Bootstrap the HCW lab host. Re-runnable: the owner runs it first as root over
# SSH on the adopted Ubuntu 26.04 LTS host (infra-lab/README.md, step 7; the
# Hostinger provider cannot attach a post-install script to a server that
# already exists), and re-runs it after a change merges to main or the vault
# changes; each run brings the host to the current main commit (HCW_REPO_REF
# below). Everything the host ends up running is declared under ansible/; this
# script only gets Ansible there.
#
# It configures only a host that was prepared for it. The first run on a host
# refuses, before it changes anything, when the host shows another workload
# (a container, a self-hosted runner, Kubernetes, a foreign /opt or listener);
# "The first-run host check" below has the checks and the way past them.
#
# The vault is optional on purpose. Without /etc/hcw/ansible/vault.yml the
# playbook still hardens the host, installs Docker, node_exporter and Caddy
# (serving plain HTTP) and installs the agent unit without starting it. With
# it, Caddy holds the wildcard certificate and the agent runs.
#
# Python. Ansible's control side (ansible-playbook, templating, the vault)
# runs on CPython from uv, not on the distribution's python3. Owner rule
# 2026-09-26: Python is on the newest release line and no more than two patch
# releases behind that line's newest (3.14.7 then, so a 3.14.5 floor), and
# Ubuntu 26.04's /usr/bin/python3 is 3.14.4 (python3.14 3.14.4, package
# python3 3.14.3), below that floor. uv comes from its GitHub release asset, checked against
# UV_SHA256 before it runs (no curl | sh), and uv checks the interpreter it
# downloads against the SHA256 it carries for that build, so the two pins
# below fix the interpreter's bytes too. The one recorded exception: modules
# still EXECUTE on the host's /usr/bin/python3 (ansible_python_interpreter in
# ansible/inventory/localhost.yml), because python3-apt, python3-debian and
# python3-docker, which the apt, deb822_repository and community.docker
# modules import, are distribution packages built for the distribution's
# Python and cannot be loaded by another interpreter.

# The first-run host check. Never configure a host that was not prepared for
# this repository.
#
# On 2026-09-26 the first run on the lab VPS met a host that had never been
# reinstalled: two self-hosted GitHub Actions runners, Portainer, an nginx site
# on :80, k3s, Vault and a July install of the old agent in
# /opt/hcw-labs-agent. Before failing at the agent's checkout it upgraded and
# restarted Docker (killing a running Dependabot job), enabled ufw and rewrote
# sshd's configuration. So a host this script has never accepted is examined
# first, before this script changes anything, and a host that shows another
# workload is refused, with what was found and the two ways on: reinstall, or
# HCW_ADOPT_NONEMPTY_HOST=1 to accept it knowingly.
#
# The first run that passes (or is told to adopt the host) writes
# HCW_HOST_MARKER before its first change, and every run that finishes adds
# its commit and time. While the marker exists the check is skipped, so a
# re-run is never judged on this repository's own work: a first run that fails
# half-way has already installed Docker, Caddy and uv, and the host was
# accepted before any of that. Delete the marker only to make the next run
# check again.
#
# Each check names a thing this repository never creates on a host it has not
# accepted, and each would have caught the 2026-09-26 host:
#
#   - any Docker container, running or stopped: the Docker role upgrades and
#     restarts the daemon, and a restart starts every stopped container whose
#     restart policy is `always`, so a stopped one is as much in the way;
#   - an installed actions.runner.* systemd unit (a self-hosted runner, which
#     ADR 0025 and ADR 0032 reject on this public repository's hosts);
#   - Kubernetes: a k3s, k0s, rke2, kubelet or microk8s unit, or k3s's and
#     kubeadm's own directories (ADR 0032: no Kubernetes on this host);
#   - labs_agent_home, or the repository checkout, holding anything but a
#     checkout of this repository;
#   - anything else under /opt, where the old agent, the runners and vendor
#     installs live and where a fresh Ubuntu has nothing;
#   - a TCP listener other than sshd's port 22 and systemd-resolved's
#     127.0.0.53 and 127.0.0.54 port 53 (the old host's nginx held :80).
#
