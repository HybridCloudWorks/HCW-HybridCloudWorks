/**
 * The lab launcher's logic: what the site's pane shows between "open this
 * lab" and the editor (ADR 0032, amendment "Coder in the site's panes", note
 * of 2026-09-28 on the launcher).
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. The lab is reached only through panes on
 * https://hybridcloudworks.com, and Caddy redirects any top-level visit
 * (lab_panes_only). Coder's dashboard opens code-server in a new window or
 * tab (`open_in` has no same-frame value in Coder v2.37.3), and a new window
 * is a top-level visit, so from the dashboard the editor can never open in
 * the pane. The launcher is a page on Coder's own name that the pane loads
 * instead. It reads the learner's workspace with the learner's own Coder
 * session, and when code-server is healthy it replaces itself with
 * code-server's own subdomain. code-server stays on its own origin, away
 * from Coder's API.
 *
 * WHAT IT MAY DO, and nothing more:
 *   - GET only, same origin, with the learner's session cookie, to three
 *     paths: who is signed in, their workspace for this lab, and, before
 *     Coder's create page is ever framed, the template. No request here
 *     changes anything in Coder, so it needs no CSRF token. Creating or
 *     starting a workspace is Coder's own UI in a frame of the same origin,
 *     with Coder's own consent dialog and buttons.
 *   - Everything it builds comes from constants below: the lab id and the
 *     workspace name from LAB_WORKSPACES, the template name, and the host
 *     suffix it navigates to. The query string only selects a key of
 *     LAB_WORKSPACES, and no text from it reaches the page.
 *   - The one address it takes from Coder is code-server's
 *     `subdomain_name`, and only when it is exactly the name Coder v2.37.3
 *     builds (`code-server--<workspace>--<owner>`, coderd/database/db2sdk
 *     AppSubdomain: no agent segment for a named app) for this workspace
 *     and the signed-in learner's own username (`/api/v2/users/me`).
 *
 * Pure: no DOM, no globals. main.js wires it to the page, and
 * scripts/lab-host-launcher.test.mjs drives it with a mocked fetch, clock and
 * navigation.
