/**
 * The one-shot behind bin/report-coder-automation.js: the lab host's Coder
 * upkeep hands its report, and a renewed status token when it has one, to
 * the site (2026-10-08).
 *
 * The host cannot write the token to Key Vault, by design: the vault's
 * firewall denies it, and the agent's certificate is the one credential the
 * host holds. So the token travels the way everything else the host tells
 * the site travels, through the agent's API client (lib/api.js): the same
 * certificate, the same scope, the same timeout, the same error shape, and
 * agentId from the same configuration (lib/config.js). The server verifies
 * the token against Coder before it stores it
 * (functions/src/lib/labs/coder-automation.js).
 *
 * THE CONTRACT WITH THE CALLER
 *
 *   stdin   ONE JSON object: `{ statusToken?, report }`, the route's body
 *           without agentId, which comes from LABS_AGENT_ID (or the
 *           hostname) like every other call this agent makes. Any other key,
 *           agentId included, is refused here before anything is sent.
 *   stdout  `{"ok":true,"stored":<bool>}` and a newline, exit 0, when the
 *           site recorded the report; `stored` says whether it took a token.
 *   stderr  On any failure, ONE line: the error's class and nothing else
 *           (lib/log.js errorClass), exit 1. `HTTP 422` is a token that
 *           failed one of the site's checks (it works, it is the status
 *           user's, it can only read), `HTTP 400` a report the site would
 *           not read (a host clock more than ten minutes fast among them),
 *           `HTTP 403` an agent the registry does not know or has
 *           deactivated. After a 422 the site's sentence is the report's
 *           `lastError` on the Integrations card, never this output; a 400
 *           records nothing.
 *           `INVALID_INPUT`, `INPUT_TOO_LARGE` and `MISSING_CONFIG` are this
 *           side's own; `UNEXPECTED_ANSWER` a 2xx that did not say ok.
 *
 * THE TOKEN IS NEVER WRITTEN ANYWHERE BUT THE REQUEST. Not on stdout, which
 * carries two fixed fields; not on stderr, which carries a class, never a
 * message, because a server refusal or a fetch error may quote what it was
 * sent; and not in an argument, because it arrives on stdin, where a process
 * listing cannot see it. lib/report-coder-automation.test.js feeds a token
 * through every path and looks for it in everything written.
