# There is no credential in this block on purpose, and its absence is the
# configuration — not an omission to be "fixed" by adding client_id/secret.
#
# Runs execute in HCP Terraform with dynamic provider credentials. When the
# workspace has TFC_AZURE_PROVIDER_AUTH=true and TFC_AZURE_RUN_CLIENT_ID set,
# HCP Terraform mints a short-lived OIDC token per run phase and exports
# ARM_CLIENT_ID, ARM_OIDC_TOKEN and ARM_USE_OIDC into the run environment; the
# azurerm provider picks those up with no HCL. ARM_TENANT_ID is a plain
# workspace environment variable alongside them.
#
# The identity behind TFC_AZURE_RUN_CLIENT_ID is created ONCE, outside this
# configuration, by scripts/bootstrap-terraform-oidc.ps1 — Terraform cannot
# create the credential Terraform authenticates with. See the Bootstrap section
# of the Deployment Runbook. The GitHub Actions identity in oidc.tf is a
# different handshake and is managed here.
# One provider per subscription. The default (unaliased) provider is the
# APPLICATION subscription because the overwhelming majority of resources are
# the workload; only the handful that belong to a platform landing zone carry
# an explicit `provider = azurerm.<alias>`. That way the common case cannot be
# got wrong by forgetting an argument.
#
# subscription_id is set in HCL on every provider, so it does not depend on
# ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID. That variable remains the provider's fallback and is
# what HCP Terraform's dynamic credentials export, but it no longer decides
# where anything lands — an explicit value here always wins.
#
# azurerm 5.0 changed resource-provider registration from `legacy` (roughly 60
# providers registered at startup) to `none`. On a subscription nobody has
# deployed to, that surfaces at apply time as MissingSubscriptionRegistration,
# which does not say what to do about it. The registration list is therefore
# explicit — and a variable, so it can be emptied in one place when ALZ
# absorption moves registration to central governance.

# There is deliberately no `ident` alias. The Identity landing zone is empty —
# HCWSite authenticates against Entra ID, and app registrations are tenant
# objects rather than subscription resources — so an alias for it would be a
# declaration with nothing to declare. tflint flags exactly that
# (terraform_unused_declarations), and it is right to: an unused alias also
# forces subscription_ident to be supplied for no benefit, which is one more
# value that must be correct before a plan can run and one more chance to get
# it wrong.
#
# Add it, and its variable, in the same change that adds the first Identity
# resource. That is a five-line addition, not a refactor.
