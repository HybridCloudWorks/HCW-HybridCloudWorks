# =============================================================================
# lab-hybrid.tf — the Azure half of the Hybrid Lab (ADR 0032 decision 3, #664)
# =============================================================================
#
# The lab host itself is a Hostinger VPS, provisioned from the separate
# `hcw-lab` workspace (`infra-lab/`) and onboarded to Azure Arc by Ansible.
# What lives in THIS workspace is only what the production estate needs in
# order to see it:
#
#   - the resource group the Arc machine is onboarded into,
#   - a Reader grant on that group for the Function App's managed identity, so
#     GET /api/public/labs/estate can read the machine's status through Azure
#     Resource Graph (functions/src/lib/labs/estate.js), and, from #663,
#   - the onboarding service principal's only grant, Azure Connected Machine
#     Onboarding on this group,
#   - a data collection rule sending heartbeat and auth/authpriv syslog to the
#     existing Management workspace,
#   - an audit-only machine-configuration assignment of the Linux security
#     baseline on this group, and, from #726,
#   - a lab-only Key Vault holding one key, the seal key HashiCorp Vault on the
#     host unseals itself with, and the Arc machine's one grant: wrap and
#     unwrap on that key.
#
# Nothing else. The Arc machine resource is created by `azcmagent connect` on
# the host (lab-host/ansible/roles/arc), under that service principal (ADR
# 0032 decision 3; its credential is an Ansible Vault entry, never a Terraform
# value). Defender for Servers stays off (ADR 0032, alternatives considered):
# nothing here sets a Microsoft.Security pricing tier.
#
# The role assignment is the whole grant. Resource Graph returns only rows the
# caller can read, and Reader is `*/read` — so the identity can describe this
# group's contents and cannot change them, and cannot see any other group it
# was not already granted. No credential is minted or stored for this path:
# the Function App's system identity signs its own token.

# Not an entry in local.app_resource_groups (main.tf): that map names the
# `site` workload's groups, and this is the `hybrid` workload's, so the name
# takes a different middle segment and the ADR fixes it in full —
# rg-lab-hybrid-prod-cus. It is also a lifecycle boundary of its own: deleting
# the lab must never be "delete rg-web", and vice versa.

#     Azure RBAC principal (Contributor + Role Based Access Control
#     Administrator) with no Entra directory role, the same boundary oidc.tf
#     records for app registrations.
#   - A secret minted by Terraform would sit in state. The credential is used
#     once by `azcmagent connect` from Ansible Vault and then deleted
#     (docs/runbooks/labs-host.md), so it never passes through here.
#
# Null until the owner has created the principal, so the rest of the estate
# keeps planning in the meantime. principal_type is explicit because the
# principal is new when this first applies: without it ARM looks the id up in
# Entra first and can miss a principal that has not replicated yet.

# Data collection rule (#663)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Heartbeat, auth/authpriv syslog, the four host counters the lab alerts read,
# and the warning-and-above lines of the service facilities, so ingestion
# stays at kilobytes a day against the workspace's daily cap (ADR 0032
# consequences). Until 2026-10-06 the rule carried heartbeat and auth syslog
# only, node_exporter listened on loopback for a scrape that never came, and
# nothing alerted on any lab signal — the estate review's finding LAB-2: the
# visitor learned the agent was offline before the owner did. The three
# rules below this one are what the added streams feed.
#
# Perf: four counters at 60 s is about 6 KB a day. Syslog: the daemon,
# syslog, kern, cron and user facilities at Warning and above only — Caddy's
# renewal errors, Vault's seal errors, the agent's crash lines and the
# failure notifier (`hcw-unit-failed@`, lab-host/ansible/roles/hardening)
# all log there — while auth stays at Info because a login is Info.
#
# Heartbeat has no data source: the Azure Monitor Agent writes a Heartbeat row
# every minute to each Log Analytics destination of every rule associated with
# it. Declaring the workspace as a destination IS the heartbeat.
#
# Levels are Info and above. sshd logs failed and accepted logins at Info, so
# dropping Info would drop the one signal this rule exists for; Debug is the
# only level left out, because it is where a chatty PAM module multiplies
# volume without adding a login event.
#
# The workspace is in the Management subscription and this rule is in the
# application one. A cross-subscription destination is allowed; a
# cross-region one is not, so the rule takes the workspace's own location
# rather than repeating var.azure_location and hoping the two agree.
#
# The association to the machine is NOT here. Its target is the Arc machine's
# resource id, which does not exist until `azcmagent connect` has run, so a
# Terraform association would fail every apply until then. The owner installs
# the Azure Monitor Agent extension and creates the association with the two
# `az` commands in docs/runbooks/labs-host.md once the machine is Connected.
# Both are needed: an association made outside the portal's DCR wizard does
# not install the agent.

# Vault auto-unseal: a lab-only Key Vault, one key, one grant (#726)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HashiCorp Vault on the lab host seals itself on every restart. With a
# `seal "azurekeyvault"` stanza it unseals itself instead, by asking this key to
# unwrap its root key. It authenticates as the Arc machine's system-assigned
# identity through the agent's local endpoint, so nothing is stored on the
# host for it (ADR 0032, amendment of 2026-09-29, which records how that was
# verified against Vault 2.1.1's source).
#
# Three boundaries, each one load-bearing:
#
#   - A vault of its own, never kv-site-prod-cus-01. The host runs learner
#     workloads and an escape is root, which can use the Arc identity. So the
#     identity must reach nothing but this key.
#   - One key, created through Resource Manager rather than the Key Vault data
#     plane, so the Terraform run identity needs no data-plane role on any
#     vault (the doctrine that removed terraform_kv_secrets from keyvault.tf,
#     T-748). Creating a key this way needs only the
#     Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/keys/write action, which Contributor carries.
#   - The grant is scoped to that one key, not the vault, and is the narrowest
#     built-in role covering what Vault calls: read the key, wrap, unwrap.

# The vault. Standard tier: the key is software-protected, and Standard charges
# nothing a month for either, only per operation (Azure Retail Prices API,
# Central US, read 2026-09-29: "Operations" $0.03 and "Advanced Key Operations"
# $0.15 per 10,000). The name is 24 characters, the Key Vault maximum: the
# pattern's kv-lab-hybrid-prod-cus-01 is 25, so the workload token loses its
# hyphen (docs/standards/naming-convention.md, "Constraints that override the
# pattern": the limit wins).
#
# The network stays open (default Allow) on purpose. The only caller is Vault
# on a VPS whose public address belongs to the hcw-lab workspace, and nothing
# in infra/ reads hcw-lab (ADR 0032 decision 1). An IP rule would copy that
# address here, and if the two ever disagreed Vault could not unseal: its
# recovery keys cannot unseal it, only this key can. Every call is still
# authenticated by Entra ID and authorised by the one key-scoped grant below,
# and every unwrap is logged with the caller's address by the diagnostic
# setting at the end of this section.
#
# Purge protection and prevent_destroy, because losing this key loses the
# Vault: HashiCorp's seal documentation says a Vault whose seal key is
# permanently deleted "cannot be recovered, even from backups". Purge
# protection is one-way: a deleted vault then stays soft-deleted, with its
# name reserved, for the 90 days below.
