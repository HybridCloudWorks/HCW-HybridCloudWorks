# Microsoft Foundry: a paid AI provider under its own budget (#849).
#
# Owner decision 2026-10-04: of about USD 75 a month, the first call is Foundry
# as a paid provider for the content features, with the cheapest text models.
# Prices read that day, per 1M tokens, Global Standard: gpt-5-nano $0.05 in /
# $0.40 out, gpt-5-mini $0.25 / $2.00. At the site's volume that is single
# dollars a month; the budget below is the ceiling, not the target.
#
# NO KEY. The Function App reaches the account with its system-assigned
# identity and the "Cognitive Services OpenAI User" role: the router asks
# @azure/identity for a token for https://cognitiveservices.azure.com and
# sends it as the bearer. `local_auth_enabled = false` means the account has
# no API keys to seed, rotate, or leak, and nothing here needs a Key Vault
# window. The app setting the router keys availability on is the ENDPOINT
# (FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT), which Terraform sets from the account.
#
# The `ai` resource group returns for this: main.tf records that the old one
# held the Azure OpenAI account removed when AI moved to external provider
# APIs. It holds exactly this account and its budget.
