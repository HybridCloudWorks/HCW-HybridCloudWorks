  # Serverless is NOT only a cost choice here — it is what makes the
  # container-per-collection shape below viable. Read this before changing it.
  #
  # Converting serverless -> provisioned throughput is IRREVERSIBLE, and the
  # documented conversion formula is `RU/s = number of partitions * 5000`. At
  # 66 containers that lands ~330,000 RU/s of manual throughput at once, and
  # even after scaling every container down by hand the floor is 400 RU/s each.
  # A consolidated design (a handful of containers with a type discriminator)
  # would floor roughly an order of magnitude lower.
  #
  # Serverless is also single-region for life: regions cannot be added after
  # account creation, and there is no autoscale.
  #
  # So three irreversible decisions are load-bearing on each other: serverless
  # capacity mode, one container per Firestore collection, and the per-container
  # partition keys. On serverless, empty and idle containers cost nothing, so
  # 66 containers is genuinely free today and keeps the per-container indexing
  # policies and the container/query contract used by the current website.
  #
  # Trigger condition: if multi-region, autoscale, or provisioned throughput is
  # ever required, container consolidation happens in the SAME project, before
  # the capacity-mode change — not after it.

# Cosmos DB Containers
#
# The container list is GENERATED from scripts/lib/migration-manifest.mjs, the

#
#     node scripts/generate-cosmos-container-spec.mjs
#
# Do not add containers here by hand — add the collection to the manifest and
# regenerate, or Terraform and the application contract drift apart.
#
# Partition keys come from the manifest: 68 on /id and five exceptions — four
# flattened subcollections keyed by their parent (content_versions on
# /contentId, image_prompts_sets on /pageId, image_prompt_sets_prompts on
# /setName, listen_and_learn_episodes on /setId) and admin_config on a
# constant /configScope so the ContentForge save stays one TransactionalBatch.
#
# /id is right for the rest because the Site-Main query load does not group by
# anything — one of ~40 content query sites filters on a provider — and the
# previous "natural" keys were wrong on their own merits: /contentId was written
# as the empty string on every document, /status on lab_jobs is mutable and a
# partition key value cannot be changed in place, and /agentId on lab_agents is
# identical to /id by construction.
#
# The subcollection exceptions are a CORRECTNESS matter, not a tuning one. Each
# assigns document ids that are unique only within their parent (a set name, a
# prompt name, an exam-area slug), so flattening them into one container under
# /id would silently overwrite documents on upsert.
#
# Full evidence, with file:line citations, in the manifest header.
#
# A partition key path is IMMUTABLE. Changing one on a container that already
# holds data means destroying the container and re-importing.
#
# THAT WINDOW IS CLOSED. This block used to read "every container here is empty
# as of 2026-08-20 — the decision window is open now and closes on the first

# Nothing masks that any more. COSMOS_CONNECTION_STRING used to sit in app
