# Action group, diagnostic settings, and the alert rules that route through it.
#
# The rules were held back until they could land with the evidence that
# motivated their thresholds. That evidence arrived on 2026-08-24, from a
# readiness review that found ZERO alert rules of any kind in either
# subscription — `az monitor metrics alert list`, `scheduledQueryRules`,
# `webtests` and `activity-log alert list` all returned empty — while the
# workspace those rules would have read from was simultaneously OverQuota. So
# the platform was both unmonitored and silently dropping the telemetry that
# would have shown it. Both halves are fixed here.
#
# Ingestion from every diagnostic setting here lands in the Log Analytics
# workspace, which carries a 0.25 GB/day cap (main.tf). The cap is the cost
# ceiling for this whole file. It is no longer a ceiling anyone has to
# remember: `logs_daily_cap` below fires at 80% of whatever the cap is set to,
# derived from the workspace resource so the two cannot drift.
#
# THRESHOLD HONESTY. Every threshold in this file is a first estimate, not an
# incident-derived number — there has never been an alert here to be wrong.
# Each one says what it assumes. Tune them against the first week of real
# firing rather than leaving an estimate in place because it is written down.

# Cosmos — ControlPlaneRequests ONLY, down from the four categories the
# approved plan named. The other three were pruned on 2026-08-24 because they
# were the reason the workspace stopped ingesting anything at all.
#
# The workspace was found in dataIngestionStatus OverQuota against a 0.25
# GB/day cap. Three days of `Usage` show where the volume goes:
#
#   AppTraces                      0.284 GB
#   CDBDataPlaneRequests           0.268 GB
#   CDBPartitionKeyRUConsumption   0.076 GB
#   AppRequests                    0.002 GB
#   AppExceptions                  0.002 GB
#
# READ THOSE AS A FLOOR, NOT A MEASUREMENT. They were sampled while the cap was
# already tripping, so every one of them is what survived the cap rather than
# what the source produced, and the shortfall is not distributed evenly — the
# cap stops collection mid-day, so a high-rate table loses proportionally more
# than a low-rate one. The list is also partial: it excludes AzureMetrics and
# the StorageRead/StorageWrite/StorageDelete categories the content_blob
# setting below ships, both of which land in the same workspace. An independent
# reading of the same period put the real figures roughly 20% away from these.
#
# What the numbers are good enough to establish is the ORDERING, which is the
# whole basis of the change: two Cosmos data-plane categories dominate, and the
# two tables an incident is actually read from are a rounding error that was
# being dropped anyway. Removing DataPlaneRequests, PartitionKeyRUConsumption
# and QueryRuntimeStatistics is therefore a large reduction — it is NOT a
# reduction to a number anyone can state in advance.
#
# CONFIRM AFTER APPLY, do not assume. Once ingestion has run uncapped for a
# full day, re-run the daily-cap usage query (the one in the logs_daily_cap
# rule below reports the same figure) and check the result against the cap. If
# it is not comfortably under, the next lever is AppTraces via host.json
# logLevel — see the sampling note on azurerm_application_insights.hcw in
# main.tf — and not another diagnostic category.
#
# WHAT THIS COSTS, stated plainly rather than buried: DataPlaneRequests was the
# per-request audit record of who read what. Losing it means a data-access
# question can no longer be answered from logs. The trade was made because a
# capped workspace answers no questions at all, and because the firewall
# (main.tf) already restricts callers to the Functions subnet and named
# operator windows. If the audit trail becomes a requirement, the answer is a
# dedicated table with a longer cap or an ingestion-time transformation that
# keeps only writes — not switching this category back on under a 0.25 GB cap.
#
# ControlPlaneRequests stays: it records firewall, key and configuration
# changes to the account, it is near-zero volume, and it is the category that
# would show an unexpected change to the account's security posture.

# There is no Azure OpenAI diagnostic setting, because there is no Azure
# OpenAI account: model calls go to external provider APIs (see the app
# settings in main.tf). Their request logs live with the provider, not here.

# =============================================================================
# Alert rules
#
# All of them route to azurerm_monitor_action_group.ops above, for the reason
# that action group exists: changing who gets paged is one edit, not eight.
#
# CROSS-SUBSCRIPTION ACTION GROUP, AND EXACTLY WHAT IS PROVEN ABOUT IT. The
# action group lives in the Management subscription; every rule below that
# watches a workload resource has to be created in the APPLICATION
# subscription, because an Azure Monitor alert rule sits in the same
# subscription as the resource it scopes. So every one of these references
# crosses a subscription boundary.
#
# The rules here have no second path. azurerm_monitor_metric_alert and
# azurerm_monitor_scheduled_query_rules_alert_v2 can only route through an
# action group — there is no per-rule email field to fall back to. So if the
# reference were accepted and silently inert, this file would produce alert
# rules that exist, make `az monitor metrics alert list` non-empty, and page
# nobody: strictly WORSE than the visible emptiness this file was written
# against, because it looks fixed. That is why delivery had to be seen, not
# inferred from an accepted apply.
#
# It has been seen, on both halves of the path:
#
#   - The hop. alert-app-exceptions-prod-cus, a rule in the application
#     subscription, fired at 23:06 UTC on 2026-08-25 and its mail arrived
#     every five to ten minutes until it was made stateful (CHANGELOG.md,
#     "The alert rules re-notified every five minutes").
#   - The receivers. A CLI test notification
#     (`az monitor action-group test-notifications create`) reached ops-email
#     and then ops-sms on 2026-08-30 (CHANGELOG.md, "Observe an alert actually
#     being delivered"). The portal's "Test action group" button reported
#     Unknown and delivered nothing the same day; use the CLI.
#
# The budget was never evidence either way, because it also carries
# contact_emails as an independent path. Re-prove delivery the same way after
# any change to this action group: docs/runbooks/alerting-and-support.md,
# "Delivery is proven, on both channels", has the commands.
#
# WHERE THEY LIVE. Every application-subscription rule is in the `web` resource
# group, next to Application Insights, rather than beside the resource it
# watches. "What pages us" is then one list in one place instead of a rule
# hiding in each service's group.
#
# METRIC ALERTS OVER LOG ALERTS, where there is a choice. A log alert reads the
# Log Analytics workspace, so it goes silent exactly when the workspace stops
# ingesting — which is the failure this file was rewritten to fix. Platform
# metrics are not ingested into the workspace, are not billed by the GB, and
# keep evaluating through an OverQuota window. Only the two conditions with no
# metric equivalent (application exceptions, workspace capacity) are log alerts.
# =============================================================================

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Identities for the two log alert rules
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A scheduled query rule with no identity runs as whoever last edited it.
# Microsoft: "If you don't use a managed identity, the alert rule will inherit
# the permissions of the last user or service principal who edited it, based on
# their permissions at the time of that edit." Here that would be the HCP
# Terraform run principal, frozen at apply time, recorded nowhere in this
# configuration and invisible in the portal.
#
# That is a bad property for any rule and an actively dangerous one for
# logs_daily_cap, whose entire job is that the workspace cap cannot trip
# quietly again. A rule running on borrowed, unrecorded permissions fails
# SILENTLY when those permissions lapse — and the thing it was watching for is
# itself silent. Two silences on top of each other is how the original
# OverQuota went unnoticed.
#
# TWO IDENTITIES, NOT ONE, and that is not symmetry for its own sake. The rules
# sit in different subscriptions, and Microsoft's managed identity FAQ is
# explicit: "If you need to use a managed identity in a different resource
# group or subscription, you would need to create a new user-assigned managed
# identity and assign the necessary permissions to it." Attaching one identity
# across the boundary is not a supported shape, and this apply cannot be
# rehearsed. Separating them also draws a real line: the platform capacity
# alert's identity cannot read application telemetry, and the application
# alert's identity cannot read anything in Management beyond the workspace.
#
# USER-ASSIGNED, NOT SYSTEM-ASSIGNED, because of ordering. Microsoft describes
# system-assigned as "This identity has no permissions... AFTER you create the
# rule, you must assign permissions", and user-assigned as "BEFORE you create
# the alert rule, you create an identity and assign it appropriate permissions".
# Only the second can be expressed as one deterministic apply. It also avoids a
# documented trap: managed identity tokens are cached per resource URI for
# around 24 hours and "it can take several hours for changes to a managed
# identity's permissions to take effect" — so granting a role after the
# identity has already been refused once is not reliably a quick fix.
#
# The depends_on on each rule is what actually enforces the ordering. Without
# it Terraform sees the rule depend on the IDENTITY (through identity_ids) and
# not on the role assignment, and is free to create the rule first — which
# throws away the only reason to prefer user-assigned. Role assignment
# propagation is still eventually consistent, so a first apply can occasionally
# fail query validation on a role that has not landed yet; re-applying is the
# fix, and it converges rather than needing repair.

# LOG ANALYTICS READER RATHER THAN READER OR MONITORING READER, and the

# out, a worker that died mid-request. That is deliberately wider than
# AppExceptions below, and the two are not redundant — a 500 with no exception
# is the host, an exception with no 500 is a handler that caught and degraded.
#
# THRESHOLD ASSUMPTION: more than 5 server errors in 15 minutes. This app
# scales to zero and a cold start can fail a request, so one or two in a window
# is noise. Nothing has fired yet to calibrate this; if the first week is
# quiet, lower it.
# A LOG rule, not a metric alert. Flex Consumption does not publish HTTP
# metrics at all: `az monitor metrics list-definitions` on this app returns

# Premium plans. ARM rejects the metric alert outright -- "Couldn't find a
# metric named Http5xx" -- which is how this was found, on the first apply
# (2026-08-25), after four reviews had all assumed the metric existed.

#
# THIS IS A METRIC ALERT AND NOT THE SCHEDULED QUERY RULE THE REVIEW ASKED FOR,
# and the reason is in the diagnostic setting above. A KQL rule for 429s would
# have to read CDBDataPlaneRequests, which is the category that was just
# removed for consuming a third of the daily cap. Restoring it to feed a
# throttling alert would re-create the OverQuota condition the alert exists to
# help with. The platform metric carries the same signal, costs no ingestion,
# and — unlike any log alert — keeps evaluating while the workspace is capped.
#
# TotalRequests split on StatusCode is the documented way to see 429s; there is
# no dedicated throttled-request metric on this account type. `Count` is the
# metric's own aggregation type, not a choice.
#
# THRESHOLD ASSUMPTION: more than 10 throttled requests in 15 minutes. The
# Cosmos SDK retries a 429 transparently, so a handful is invisible to callers
# and normal. Ten in a window means retries are no longer absorbing it. This
# account is serverless — there is no provisioned RU dial to turn up, so a
# firing alert points at the query or the partition key, not at throughput.

# Log Analytics — ingestion is approaching the daily cap
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# THE POINT OF THIS RULE IS THAT THE CAP CANNOT TRIP QUIETLY AGAIN. The
# workspace was found OverQuota — dropping every table, including the ones
# every other rule in this file reads — with nothing anywhere saying so.
# Microsoft's guidance for the daily cap is an alert on
# `_LogOperation ... OverQuota`, but that fires once collection has ALREADY
# stopped. This one fires at 80% of the cap, while there is still headroom to
# prune a category or raise the ceiling deliberately.
#
# It can fire from inside a capped workspace, which no other log alert here
# can: the daily cap stops collection of BILLABLE tables, and `Usage` is not
# billable. That is also why the query filters IsBillable — unbillable rows do
# not count against the cap and must not count here either.
#
# THE RESET HOUR IS NOT THE DAY BOUNDARY. Azure assigns each workspace its own
# cap reset hour and it cannot be configured; this one resets at 08:00 UTC
# (quotaNextResetTime on the live workspace, read 2026-08-24). Summing from
# midnight would under-count for eight hours after every reset and over-count
# before it, so the window starts at the most recent reset instead:
# startofday(now() - 8h) + 8h is the last 08:00 UTC that has passed.
#
# No attribute on azurerm_log_analytics_workspace exposes the reset hour, so
# the 8 is a literal. If the workspace is ever recreated Azure may assign a
# different hour — check `az monitor log-analytics workspace show --query
# quotaNextResetTime` and correct it here.
#
# The threshold is DERIVED from the workspace's own cap so the two cannot
# drift. It reads the RESOURCE attribute, not the variable behind it, so
# raising logs_daily_quota_gb in the workspace moves this with it and no edit
# here is needed — which is what makes the T-719 measurement a variable change
# rather than a code change. It is also why that variable refuses -1: an
# unlimited workspace would put a negative number on the line below.
#
# mute_actions_after_alert_duration rather than auto-mitigation, and the two
# are mutually exclusive on this resource. Ingestion only goes up between
# resets, so once it is past 80% it stays past — an hourly evaluation would
# otherwise send the same mail every hour until the reset, which is how a
# useful alert becomes a mail rule.

# Availability — is the API answering at all, from outside Azure
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every other rule in this file watches a resource that is up enough to emit
# telemetry. This is the only one that can tell the difference between "the API
# is healthy" and "nothing is reaching the API", because it asks from the
# outside, over the same Cloudflare path a browser uses.
#
# CREATED DISABLED, AND THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT. Two independent reasons:
#
#   1. Bot Fight Mode. deploy-functions.yml carries the measurement: a
#      GitHub-hosted runner asking this host for /api/health is served
#      Cloudflare's "Just a moment..." interstitial and a 403, and that
#      challenge does not run on the Ruleset Engine — a WAF skip rule was
#      built, applied and confirmed INERT against it. Availability-test agents
#      are datacenter clients of exactly the same shape. Arming this before
#      that is settled most likely produces a rule that fires continuously and
#      is muted by whoever receives it, which is worse than no alert at all.
#   2. Standard tests bill PER EXECUTION, and the free URL ping test retires
#      2026-09-30. At the defaults below — 5 locations every 15 minutes — that
#      is 5 x 96 x 30 = 14,400 executions a month. Against a platform whose
#      entire current Azure spend is about USD 3.23 a month, that is not a
#      rounding error and it should be spent knowingly.
#
# TO ARM IT: give the availability agents a path through Cloudflare — the
# supported pattern is Microsoft's custom-header identifier below plus a
# Cloudflare rule that admits it, or the ApplicationInsightsAvailability
# service tag — confirm one execution succeeds, then set
# availability_test_enabled = true in the workspace. That one variable arms the
# test and creates the alert together: the alert is gated on the same variable,
# so that an inventory of alert rules cannot show a reachability alert that
# nothing can fire.
#
# The X-Customer-InstanceId header is Microsoft's documented way to prove a
# request came from THIS test rather than from anyone else sharing the
# availability service's IP addresses. It is set now so the Cloudflare rule has
# something to match on when someone writes it; it authenticates nothing on its

#
# The standard web test above is the design; this is the one that can run.
# Bot Fight Mode 403s every datacenter client asking /api/health — Azure's
# availability agents included — and does not run on the Ruleset Engine, so no
# WAF rule exempts them (the block comment above carries the measurement). The
# alternative is edge/availability-probe: a Cloudflare Worker on a 5-minute
# cron, deployed by the owner with wrangler, whose subrequest to its own zone
# is the one external-shaped client Bot Fight Mode does not challenge. It
# reports every attempt to Application Insights as an availability result
# named edge-api-health — wrangler.toml's PROBE_NAME, which the query below
# must match verbatim.
#
# THE RULE COUNTS SUCCESSES AND FIRES ON TOO FEW, rather than counting
# failures. Counting failures has a blind spot exactly where it matters: a
# dead Worker, a disabled cron, or an unreachable ingestion endpoint produce
# no failure rows at all, and a failure-counting rule reads that silence as
# health. Counting successes makes "the probe stopped running" and "the API
# stopped answering" the same incident, which they are from a visitor's seat.
# The probe writes 6 results per 30-minute window; below 3 is an incident, so
# ingestion lag plus one dropped cron run is tolerated (T-745).
#
# THE WINDOW IS THE HALF OF THAT PAIR THAT GOT LEFT BEHIND, and it is recorded
# here because the rule read as fixed for four days while being worse than
# before. T-745 moved the threshold from 2 to 3 and rewrote every comment,
# `description` and wrangler.toml note to describe a 30-minute window — and
# left `window_duration` at PT15M. Three rows per window against a threshold of
# 3 tolerates NOTHING: one row landing a minute late is a Sev 1 on a healthy
# site, where the pre-T-745 shape (PT15M, threshold 2) at least tolerated one.
# Half a fix inverted the finding it closed. Corrected 2026-09-01, before the
# variable below was ever armed.
#
# A log rule, not a metric alert on availabilityResults/availabilityPercentage,
# for the same blind-spot reason: that metric goes silent when the probe dies,
# and a metric alert on a silent metric does not fire.
#
# Gated on its own variable rather than availability_test_enabled: the two
# paths arm independently, and arming THIS one first (or instead) is the
# expected order — it costs nothing per execution. The gate also has the same
# duty as every other in this file: created before the probe writes rows, the
# rule fires immediately and permanently, so the variable's description makes
# the observed success row the precondition for flipping it.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Cosmos export — the missing-run alerts (ADR 0028 §5, #231)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The exporter behind FEATURE_FLAG_COSMOS_EXPORT (functionapp.tf) runs at
# 03:00 UTC every day: a full read of every exported container on Sunday, the
# change feed since the previous run on the other six.
#
# "03:00 UTC" IS LOAD-BEARING IN THIS FILE AND WAS ONCE UNTRUE. The schedule
# is the bare NCRONTAB hour `0 0 3 * * *`, which means whatever the app clock
# means. Until 2026-09-07 that clock was WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE = America/Chicago,
# so the exporter actually ran at 08:00 UTC in summer and 09:00 in winter
# while every sentence here — and the daily rule's DESCRIPTION, which is what
# arrives in the alert mail — said 03:00 UTC. An operator reading that at
# 05:00 UTC would have gone looking for a run that was not due for another
# three hours (#416). The owner's answer was that all times in this app are
# UTC: the setting is gone, the app clock is the platform default, and these
# sentences became true rather than being rewritten. The guard against the
# setting coming back is
# functions/src/functions/timer-schedules-utc.test.js.
#
# A run that completes emits one Application Insights custom event named
# cosmosExportCompleted with customDimensions.mode set to "full" or "delta"
# — nothing else about the run is in the event, and nothing in these queries
# wants more. Success is silent and only absence pages, for the reason the
# edge-probe rule above gives: a dead timer, a flag left off, a poisoned queue
# and a failed write all produce NO rows, and a rule that counted failures
# reads every one of them as health.
#
# TWO DAYS IS AS FAR BACK AS A LOG ALERT CAN LOOK, and both rules are shaped
# by that. Azure caps a log search alert's query time range at two days —
# the window and the override alike — and says so plainly: "even if the query
# contains an ago command with a time range of longer than two days, the
# two-day maximum time range is applied". "No full in eight days" therefore
# cannot be written as an eight-day lookback. What can be written:
#
#   alert-cosmos-export-daily asks, once a day, whether ANY run completed in
#   the last two days. Any run, not delta alone as the ADR's shorthand has it:
#   Sunday's run is a full, so the gap between Saturday's delta and Monday's
#   is 48 hours — exactly the window — and an evaluation landing in the
#   minutes between those two completions would page about a healthy week.
#   Counting both modes makes the widest healthy gap 24 hours against 48.
#
#   alert-cosmos-export-full asks, on Mondays only, whether a full completed
#   in the last two days. A window that ends anywhere on Monday contains the
#   whole of Sunday, so a full that ran on schedule is inside it whatever
#   hour Azure evaluates at; on the other six days the query returns 0 and
#   the rule is quiet. The ADR's eight days of tolerance becomes "the Sunday
#   just gone" — stricter, and the reading the cap permits.
#
# STATELESS, unlike every other rule in this file, and not by choice. Azure
# does not allow auto-mitigation on a rule evaluated less often than every
# twelve hours ("Stateful alert rules can be configured with a frequency of
# up to 12 hours"), and these evaluate daily because what they watch happens
# daily. Each description states the consequence: the daily rule mails once
# a day until a run completes, the Monday rule once per missed Sunday.
# Neither resolves itself, and neither should — a late run is not the
# incident, a stale copy is, and it stays stale until the next good run.
#
# GATED ON cosmos_export_enabled, the variable that also sets the app flag,
# so the rules cannot exist while the exporter is off — the "created before
# the first row, fires on the first evaluation" trap the probe rule above
# describes. One variable closes most of it; the variable's description in
# variables.tf names the residue (the first evaluation may precede the first
# 03:00 UTC run, and a flag that arrives on a Sunday after 03:00 has no full
# for Monday to find).
#
# customEvents, not AppEvents: the scope is the component, which resolves the
# classic schema, exactly as the exceptions rule explains. customDimensions
# is a dynamic column, hence the tostring() before comparing.

# =============================================================================
# PLAT-4 (#964): silence, the poison queue, the bandwidth ceiling, and the
# security conditions nothing paged on
# =============================================================================
#
# The estate assessment of 2026-10-06 found the rules above watching errors
# and latency while four kinds of failure stayed silent: a timer that stopped
# running, a job the queue gave up on, the Static Web App's monthly bandwidth
# running out, and every security-relevant change: role assignments, vault
# configuration, vault data writes, failed vault calls. Every rule below reads
# data the estate ALREADY collects (the diagnostic settings above, the
# Application Insights component, the Activity Log), so none of them adds a
# byte of ingestion against the 0.25 GB/day cap.
#
# Two shapes, chosen per condition for cost:
#
#   - Activity Log alerts for Azure Resource Manager writes. They are free
#     ("collection and alerting on the Activity log" carries no charge,
#     Microsoft's Azure Monitor cost page) and need no export: the Activity
#     Log is evaluated where it already is. Exporting it to the workspace
#     would add ingestion and a paid log rule for the same signal.
#   - Log search alerts for what only a log carries: data-plane vault calls,
#     queue writes, timer invocations, the agent-health trace. Each is a paid
#     rule (USD 0.50 a month at a 15-minute frequency, Azure Retail Prices
#     API, read 2026-10-10), which is why none runs more often than every 15
#     minutes.
#
# Workspace-scoped rules follow logs_daily_cap and the lab rules: Management
# provider, resource group and identity. Component-scoped rules follow the
# Telegram rule: application resource group, component scope, classic schema,
# alerts_app identity. Every one routes to the one action group, and every
# one is created ENABLED, which is why each has a way to make it fire once in
# docs/runbooks/alerting-and-support.md ("The PLAT-4 rules").

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Timers — one that should have run has no successful run
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Before this, one timer in twenty-five had a silence alert (the Cosmos
# exporter's two, above) and the other twenty-four could stop for a week
# unnoticed. The registration monitor catches a timer that is not REGISTERED;
# nothing caught one that is registered and not running, or running and
# failing every time.
#
# ONE RULE, ONE TIME SERIES PER TIMER. The query returns a row for each timer
# that was due and has no successful invocation since, and `timer` is the
# dimension, so each overdue timer is its own alert naming itself, opens once
# and resolves once.
#
# HOW "DUE" IS COMPUTED. For each timer, bin_at(now() - grace, period, anchor)
# is the last scheduled time at least `grace` ago. A success (requests, the
# function's own row, success true) at or after that time means it ran. The
# grace is 45 minutes: the 30-minute non-HTTP timeout on Flex Consumption,
# plus ingestion delay, because a request row is written when the invocation
# ENDS. A disarmed timer still runs and returns early (schedulers.js), and
# that run succeeds, so the rule watches whether the host is running the
# timer at all, not whether its flag is on.
#
# THE 2-DAY CEILING, AGAIN. A log alert cannot read more than two days, so a
# weekly timer can only be judged for the day after it was due; outside that
# day its row is filtered out and it is neither healthy nor overdue. That is
# the reading the cap permits, the same one alert-cosmos-export-full takes.
#
# ONE ALERT, NOT TWENTY-FIVE, WHEN THE CAUSE IS SHARED. More than five timers
# overdue at once is one fault (the host stopped running timers, as on
# 2026-08-21, or the request rows stopped matching the names below), so the
# query collapses them into a single series named "more than five timers at
# once". `take 1`, not a summarize: a summarize with no `by` returns a row
# even from empty input, which would hold that series open forever.
#
# SILENT WHEN NOTHING AT ALL ARRIVES. If the component has received no
# request row in 30 minutes (and three timers run every five), the cause is
# not one timer: the workspace is capped, or the app is down. Without the
# `Ingesting` guard that would open one alert per timer, twenty-five mails
# and twenty-five texts for one fault. alert-logs-capacity and
# alert-api-reachability own those two, and the reachability rule fires on
# both, so this rule stays quiet rather than repeating them.
#
# A timer merged but not yet deployed is due and has never succeeded, so it
# pages from the first apply after its merge until the code deploy lands.
# That is true (the host is not running it) and closes with the deploy.
#
# `requests`, not AppRequests: the scope is the component, which resolves the
# classic schema (see alert-app-exceptions). Host.Results stays at
# Information in host.json precisely so these rows exist (T-514, T-719).

# Lab — an agent has been offline long enough to tell the owner
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# checkAgentHealth decides when a lab agent's outage is worth the owner's
# attention: offline for OFFLINE_NOTIFY_AFTER_MS (five minutes), once per
# outage, whether the agent went quiet or announced its own shutdown
# (lib/timers/agent-health.js, #1009). That decision, not the raw mark, is
# what this reads. The mark after 90 seconds of silence also fires on the
# nightly 04:30 reboot, which is back in under a minute; the decision does
# not, which is the reason #1009 moved the owner's message behind it.
#
# The decision writes one of three Warning traces, all past host.json's
# Warning floor and all content-free:
#
#   [checkAgentHealth] offline message sent for <n> agent(s)
#   [checkAgentHealth] offline message for <n> agent(s) not sent (<reason>)…
#   [checkAgentHealth] owner notification failed: <error>
#
# Any of them pages through the action group, so an offline agent reaches the
# owner by mail and SMS, and most of all when Telegram is the thing that is
# broken (the second and third lines; alert-telegram-delivery covers the
# refusal itself). The host-level view is alert-lab-heartbeat in
# lab-hybrid.tf: the host can be up with the agent down, which is the case
# this one catches. CHECK_AGENT_HEALTH must be armed for any of it.

# Activity Log — vault configuration and role assignments
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Free, and no export: an Activity Log alert is evaluated on the Activity Log
# itself. The alternative the assessment named, a diagnostic setting sending
# the Activity Log to the workspace plus a log rule, costs a paid rule and
# ingestion for the same Resource Manager events.
#
# Succeeded and Failed only. A write logs Started and then one of those, so
# without the filter every change would page twice; a Failed write is kept
# because a refused attempt to grant a role is as worth knowing as a granted
# one.
#
# An Activity Log alert watches the subscription it is in, so role
# assignments need one rule per subscription that holds a grant this estate
# depends on: the application subscription, and Management, where the
# workspace and the alert identities' grants live.
#
# Every HCP Terraform apply that creates or deletes a role assignment fires
# the RBAC rule for that subscription. That is intended: it is the second
# witness an apply does what its plan said, and the one place an assignment
# made OUTSIDE an apply shows up.

# Vault configuration: anything Resource Manager writes on either vault or
# beneath it. That covers the network ACL and every other vault property, a
# delete, keys and secrets written through Resource Manager, and role
# assignments scoped to a vault. Scopes are resource ids used as prefixes, so
# naming the two vaults is the whole filter.
