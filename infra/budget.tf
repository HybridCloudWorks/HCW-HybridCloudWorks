# Split out of main.tf on 2026-08-29 (T-754). Terraform reads every .tf file in
# this directory as ONE module: same namespace, same state, same plan. Nothing
# moved between states and no resource address changed — an empty plan is the
# proof, and `functions/test/terraform-source.js` is why the text-reading guards
# did not need to care.

# Scoped to the SUBSCRIPTION, not a resource group. It was resource-group
# scoped while the workload was one group; splitting into six by service
# category would have left the budget watching whichever one it was pinned to
# and silently ignoring the other five — a budget that under-reports is worse
# than none, because it reads as reassurance. The application subscription is
# now the boundary that means "this workload", so that is what it watches.
#
# contact_groups crosses a subscription boundary: the budget lives in App, the
# action group in Management. This said the ARM API "doubtfully" supported that
# until 2026-08-24; the doubt is half resolved and the half that remains is the
# half that matters. This budget applied, so ARM ACCEPTS the reference. Whether
# a notification is ever DELIVERED through it is still unobserved, and this
# resource cannot tell anyone: contact_emails below is an independent path, so
# the mail arrives either way and an inert action group looks identical to a
# working one from here.
#
# That indifference is exactly what the alert rules in observability.tf do not
# have — they can only route through an action group — so the delivery test
# belongs there, and the note in that file's Alert rules header says how.
# The first of the month this plan runs in, in UTC, unless
# var.budget_start_date pins a date (#820). Until #820 the variable's default
# was a literal, 2026-08-01, that had to be moved by hand before any apply that
# CREATES a budget: a fresh subscription, a rebuild, or a forced replacement.
# From September on, that apply would have failed at the end of the graph, for
# a reason unrelated to the change being applied. plantimestamp() is fixed for
# the whole plan, and the budgets ignore the attribute once they exist, so a
# stale literal and a monthly diff are both gone.

# The second budget, because the first one is scoped to a subscription that

#
# The workload subscription is where almost everything lives, and almost
# everything there is serverless and near-free at this traffic. The one line
# that scales with load rather than with inventory is Log Analytics ingestion —
# and the workspace bills in Platform Management, which had no budget at all.
# So the thing worth watching was the thing nothing watched, and the estate
# would have looked in-budget right up to a surprise.
#
# `provider = azurerm.mgmt` for the same reason the workspace and the action
# group carry it: subscription_id below names the scope, but the provider
# decides which subscription the ARM call goes to, and without the alias this
# is written into the application subscription — where the name would collide
# with nothing and simply watch the wrong thing.
#
# Deliberately NOT scoped to the resource group. A subscription budget catches
# a cost that appears somewhere nobody expected, which is the case a budget is
# for; a resource-group budget silently ignores everything outside it.
#
# Same threshold ladder as the workload budget, and the same action group, so
# the two read identically in the inbox and neither needs its own runbook.
