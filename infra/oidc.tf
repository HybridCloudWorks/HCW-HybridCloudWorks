# =============================================================================
# oidc.tf — GitHub Actions deployment identity (federated, no stored secrets)
#
# Replaces the AZURE_CREDENTIALS GitHub secret, which held a static
# service-principal JSON. The README guardrail asks for OIDC and managed
# identities and forbids committed static cloud credentials; the workflows were
# not meeting it.
#
# WHY A USER-ASSIGNED MANAGED IDENTITY RATHER THAN AN APP REGISTRATION
#
# The usual recipe federates an Entra app registration. That requires directory
# permissions in Entra ID — Application Administrator or the tenant's
# "users may register applications" setting. Azure **Owner** does not grant it:
# Owner is Azure RBAC over subscriptions and resources, a different plane.
#
# A user-assigned managed identity is an ordinary Azure resource, and
# azurerm_federated_identity_credential attaches the trust to it directly. So
# everything here is creatable by an Azure Owner with no Entra role at all,
# which matches the permissions this deployment is expected to run under.
#
# The one thing that needs Entra rights is the API app registration behind
# var.entra_api_audience ("HCWSite API"). It is a prerequisite created by hand,
# once, and deliberately not automated here. scripts/cutover/01-entra-api.ps1
# does not create it: it asserts the registration, its scope, app roles and
# token version exist, then grants the role. If the registration is missing,
# that script stops rather than guessing. Required-Inputs §4.1 lists the
# workspace variable that carries its client id.

# RETIRED 2026-10-06 (estate review, finding SEC-2; owner decision that day):
# the two `ref:refs/heads/main` credentials on THIS identity, name form here
# and immutable form below.
#
# They trusted a subject no workflow presents. Every job that signs in as
# the deploy identity declares `environment: production`, so GitHub composes
# the environment form and the production reviewers gate the sign-in. The
# ref form was the way around that gate: any job on `main` holding
# `id-token: write` — ten workflows do, for Qlty, Pages and the manifest —
# could have signed in as this identity with no reviewer and deployed code
# that runs as the Function App's own identity. Deleting the pair closes the
# route; `scripts/oidc-subjects.test.mjs` now asserts this identity trusts
# environment-form subjects only. The reader identity keeps its ref pair
# below: its workflows name no environment and it holds read roles.
#
# `subject` must match the token's claim EXACTLY. GitHub composes it as
# repo:<org>/<repo>:environment:<name> for a job that names an environment,
# so github_org and github_repo are load-bearing — a mismatch fails at
# azure/login with AADSTS70021 and no indication of which component was wrong.

# RETIRED 2026-08-26 (T-524): the two `environment:data-migration` credentials,
# name form here and immutable form below.
#
# They trusted a subject nothing presents. `migrate-data.yml` was the only
# consumer and was deleted in `59e471b`; of the four workflows that call
# azure/login, one names `environment: production` and three name no
# environment at all, so they present the ref form. Verified against
# scripts/oidc-subjects.test.mjs, which is the check that would have caught a
# mistake here: removing this pair leaves it passing, removing only one half
# fails it on the missing form, and sweeping up the branch pair by mistake
# fails it naming all three ref-form workflows.
#
# Retiring it was always an identity decision rather than a Terraform cleanup,
# which is why the remediation branch escalated it instead of deleting it. The
# owner authorised it on 2026-08-26. Recorded here rather than only in git
# because "why does this identity trust four subjects and not six" should be
# answerable from the file.
#
# What it cost: nothing operational. A federated credential grants no
# permission of its own — it decides which OIDC subject may act AS this
# identity — and with the production-write grants already revoked, a
# data-migration token inherited the same reduced role set a branch token gets.
# What it removes is a standing trust relationship for a job that cannot run.
#
# If a migration workflow is ever rebuilt: it needs BOTH forms back, name and
# immutable, or the guard fails and azure/login fails with AADSTS700213 on
# whichever form the token happens to carry.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The SAME two subjects again, in GitHub's immutable-identifier form.
#
# GitHub now composes the subject with numeric org and repository IDs embedded:
#
#   repo:HybridCloudWorks@312844660/HCW-HybridCloudWorks@1268997852:ref:refs/heads/main
#
# rather than the documented repo:<org>/<repo>:ref:<ref>. Confirmed on
# 2026-08-20 from a real token — the first dispatch of deploy-functions.yml
# failed with AADSTS700213 and the presented subject in the error, and
# `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/oidc/customization/sub` reports
# `sub_claim_prefix` in the ID form while `use_default` is true. So this is
# GitHub's default now, not a customization anyone here made.
#
# Both forms are trusted rather than swapping to the new one, for two reasons.
# The rollout is GitHub's to reverse, and a credential that stops matching
# fails every deploy at login with an error naming nothing that changed. And
# the two are not redundant in the way they look: the name form survives an org
# rename breaking the IDs' association, the ID form survives a rename outright.
# Federated credentials are free and capped at 20; four is not a cost.
#
# Delete the name-form pair once the ID form has been stable for a release or
# two — not before, and not because it looks duplicated.
#
# The IDs are hardcoded deliberately. They are immutable by definition: that is
# the entire point of GitHub embedding them, and a variable would invite
# someone to "fix" them to something readable.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
locals {
  # repo:<org>@<org-id>/<repo>@<repo-id> — verified against the GitHub API,
  # not copied out of the error message.
  github_immutable_prefix = "repo:${var.github_org}@312844660/${var.github_repo}@1268997852"
}

# The immutable half of the deploy identity's ref pair stood here until
# 2026-10-06 (SEC-2, see the note above the retired name form). Both halves
# went together: one without the other is half a credential and fails on
# whichever form the token carries.

# The immutable half of the data-migration pair was removed here on 2026-08-26
# with its name-form twin above (T-524). Both went together deliberately: one
# without the other is half a credential and fails on whichever form the token
# carries.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# environment:production — the subject the Function App deploy actually presents
#
# `de99aa0` put deploy-functions.yml behind `environment: production` to gate
# production deploys. That is a good change with a consequence nothing here
# accounted for: **declaring an environment changes the OIDC subject.** GitHub
# composes it as repo:<org>/<repo>:environment:<name>, NOT
# repo:<org>/<repo>:ref:<ref>, so the branch credential above cannot match a
# job that names an environment — the ref form is simply not what is presented.
#
# The result was a production deploy path that could not authenticate at all,
# and it stayed invisible because no deploy ran between that merge and
# 2026-08-25. The first dispatch after it failed at azure/login:
#
#   AADSTS700213: No matching federated identity record found for presented
#   assertion subject 'repo:HybridCloudWorks@312844660/
#   HCW-HybridCloudWorks@1268997852:environment:production'
#
# Both forms again, for the reasons given above the immutable block: the name
# form survives an org rename breaking the IDs' association, the ID form
# survives a rename outright. Six credentials against a cap of 20.
#
# The rule is per-workflow, not per-repository: a workflow that names an
# environment needs an environment credential, one that does not needs the
# branch credential. The branch pair was once needed because
# heal-computed-properties.yml and publish-content-manifest.yml declared no
# environment. publish-content-manifest has signed in as the reader identity
# since T-728, and the healer was deleted in #816 part 2, so no workflow on
# THIS identity presents the ref subject, and on 2026-10-06 the owner retired
# the pair (SEC-2). These two environment credentials are the identity's
# only trust now: a sign-in as the deploy identity passes the production
# environment's reviewers or does not happen.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE READ-ONLY IDENTITY (T-728)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Until 2026-08-29 one identity served every workflow. The hourly registration
# monitor and the alert-state verifier — which read and change nothing — ran as
# the identity that also holds Website Contributor on the API, Storage Account
# Contributor and Storage Blob Data Contributor on the host storage account, and
# the Cosmos container-definition role. A postinstall script anywhere in a
# scheduled workflow's dependency tree inherited the full deploy blast radius,
# for jobs whose entire job is to look.
#
# So there are two identities now, and the division is what the job DOES, not
# which team owns it:
#
#   github_deploy   writes something      deploy-functions, deploy-azure-frontend
#   github_reader   writes nothing        monitor-functions-registered,
#                                         verify-alert-state, publish-content-manifest
#
# publish-content-manifest is on the reader side deliberately, though the
# finding's recommendation named only the first two. Its build job queries
# Cosmos and writes a JSON file into the repository — it has never needed a
# data-plane write, and it held Cosmos Data Contributor because it shared an
# identity with the healer. Splitting the identity without splitting that job
# would leave the finding half closed.
#
# All three workflows on this identity declare no `environment:`, so each
# presents the ref-form subject, and both the name and immutable-ID forms of it
# are trusted, for the reasons above the immutable block.
#
# scripts/oidc-subjects.test.mjs checks per identity now, not against one pool
# of subjects: a reader workflow needs a credential on THIS identity, and a
# pooled check would have passed on the deploy identity's.

# READER, not Monitoring Reader — and this reverses what the deploy identity
# carried, on a claim that was simply wrong.
#
# The removed block chose Monitoring Reader over Reader and argued it was the
# narrower of the two: "Reader grants read over every resource in the group ...
# the narrower role names the actual job." Monitoring Reader is not narrower.
# Checked against Microsoft's published definition rather than from memory, it
# is `*/read` PLUS Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/search/action and
# Microsoft.Support/* — a strict superset of Reader, which is `*/read` alone.
# Choosing it widened the grant while the comment claimed it narrowed it.
#
# The rest of that reasoning survives and applies here: neither role carries
# listKeys on the workspace, so this identity cannot read the ingestion keys and
# so cannot forge or drown the telemetry the alert rules evaluate.
#
# SCOPE IS THE RESOURCE GROUP. It holds the Function App, its plan, the Static
# Web App, Application Insights and the Functions host storage account, and the
# monitor reads across the first and the last of those. A per-resource grant
# would have to be re-declared every time a rule or resource is renamed, which
# is the coupling that leaves a verification path quietly broken.

# does not reach it.
#
# WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SEE, because it looks alarming next to
# func_config_refresh, which excludes this exact action. The two are different
# principals with opposite jobs: the Function App may refresh its settings and
# must not read them back, and this identity may read them and can change
# nothing. And what it reads is bounded — every credential in this estate is a
# @Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=...) reference, so the list returns the
# reference string, not the resolved secret. That is not a convention anyone has
# to remember: functions/src/functions/app-settings-secrets.test.js fails CI on a
# literal secret value in app_settings, with a short allowlist of non-secrets.

# Azure/static-web-apps-deploy CANNOT authenticate with a federated credential.
# That is not an oversight in this workflow: azure/static-web-apps#1304 is an
# open request asking Microsoft for exactly that, and until it lands the action
# takes a deployment token or nothing. So "move the SWA deploy to OIDC" cannot
# mean "stop using the token" — it means stop STORING it.
#
# What that changes, precisely, because the difference is easy to overstate:
#
#   - Retired: the `swa_token` Terraform output, visible on the HCP Terraform
#     Outputs tab to anyone with state read, and the long-lived
#     AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN GitHub secret. Neither exists after this.
#   - Unchanged: the token still exists in Terraform state via
#     azurerm_static_web_app.hcw.api_key, which is an attribute of the resource
#     and cannot be removed while the resource is managed here. outputs.tf said
#     this before the retirement and it is still true after it.
#
# The job now asks ARM for the token under the same federated identity it
# already uses, and it lives for the length of one run.
#
# WHY A CUSTOM ROLE. Microsoft.Web/staticSites/listSecrets/action is an action,
# not a read, so Reader cannot express it — the same shape as the function
# settings reader above. The built-ins that do carry it, Contributor and
# Website Contributor, also grant write over the site: the identity could
# reconfigure or delete the Static Web App to read one token. This grants the

# github_copilot_review — what GitHub Copilot code review may see in Azure
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# .github/copilot-mcp.json gives Copilot code review (and the Copilot cloud
# agent, which shares the configuration) the Azure MCP Server, restricted at
# the server to fourteen read-only control-plane tools. The server needs an
# Azure sign-in, and .github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml provides one
# with azure/login under federated identity — this identity. Verified in
# Copilot's own runner on 2026-09-06 (PR #382's session): the login succeeds
# with the client id read from the Agents store, where the owner mirrored the
# copilot_review_client_id output because that runner resolves no repository
# variables.
#
# A THIRD IDENTITY, not a reuse of github_reader, because github_reader is not
# read-only: it holds the origin-window role on the Function App (a config
# WRITE, github_reader_origin_window above) and the app-settings LIST action.
# An autonomous reviewer that calls tools without asking must hold a principal
# that can change nothing, so that a prompt-injected review comment has nothing
# to reach for. This one is Reader, at resource-group scope, and nothing else.
#
# WHAT READER CAN AND CANNOT SEE HERE. `*/read` is control plane: resource
# existence, configuration, tags, role assignments, metrics definitions,
# activity log. It carries no data action and no `list*/action`, so this
# identity cannot list storage keys, Cosmos keys, Function App settings or
# Key Vault secrets, and cannot read a blob, a document or a secret — the
# Key Vault is RBAC-mode and needs a data-plane role for that. Application
# Insights telemetry IS readable under Reader (query is an ARM action), which
# is why the MCP tool list excludes every log-query tool and keeps only metrics;
# and the telemetry is content-free by policy either way — correlation
# identifiers, never paths, query strings or payloads — a rule the pull
# request template's security review and the code-review skill's
# cross-cutting checks (.github/skills/code-review/SKILL.md) enforce on every
# change.
#
# SUBJECT IS THE copilot ENVIRONMENT, in both forms, and nothing else. Copilot's
# setup-steps job declares `environment: copilot`, so GitHub composes
# `repo:<org>/<repo>:environment:copilot` — the ref form would not match. No
# ref-form credential, because no branch-triggered workflow should ever be able
# to assume this identity by accident. The `copilot` environment exists already
# (docs/standards/required-inputs.md §4.4).
#
# Scope is the four workload groups (web, db, stor, sec). Not `conn`: nothing a
# review asks about lives in the spoke network, and not the Management
# subscription, so the central Log Analytics workspace is out of reach entirely.

#
# It existed so verify-alert-state.yml could read the live rules back. That
# workflow is on github_reader now, and the deploy identity needs nothing from
# it: deploy-functions.yml reads the Function App through Website Contributor
# (Microsoft.Web/sites/*, which covers the function list, the access
# restrictions and the app-settings list) and the host storage account through
# Storage Account Contributor. Nothing it does touches Microsoft.Insights.

# Deliberately NOT granted to the active deployment path:
#   - Key Vault access. Deploys do not read secrets; the Function App's own
#     managed identity does that at runtime.
#   - Import-only Cosmos or storage roles on PRODUCTION. These were declared
#     behind migration_writer_enabled and were LIVE on this identity until
#     2026-08-24; the gate and all three declarations were removed with the
#     rehearsal itself. See the removal record at the end of this file.
#   - Data-plane access to the CONTENT storage account. This identity writes a
#     deployment package to the FUNCTIONS host account and nothing else; the
#     media the site serves is the Function App's to write, not CI's.
#   - anything at subscription scope.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# REMOVED (#816, part 2) — the healer's container-definition role
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# azurerm_cosmosdb_sql_container cannot express computedProperties, so an apply
# that updates the `content` or `blogs` container used to wipe cp_sortDate
# (T-206). Until #816, heal-computed-properties.yml put it back every six hours
# through an ARM PUT, authorized by a custom role assigned here:
# `data.azurerm_role_definition.cosmos_container_writer` looked up
# "HCW Cosmos Container Definition Writer" and
# `azurerm_role_assignment.github_deploy_cosmos_container_writer` granted it to
# this identity at the account scope.
#
# The apply writes the property itself now, in the same run that could wipe it,
# and fails if a container lacks it afterwards
# (azapi_update_resource.cosmos_computed_properties in cosmos.tf, #829). So the
# workflow, the script's --apply path and the assignment went together, and
# this identity no longer holds any Cosmos control-plane write. The role
# DEFINITION was the owner's, created by hand from infra/roles/ because the
# Terraform identity cannot create definitions, so it is deleted by hand too,
# after the apply that destroys the assignment (Azure refuses to delete a
# definition that still has one).
#
# The two container-scoped DATA-PLANE grants (Cosmos Data Contributor on
# `content` and `blogs` for this identity) outlived that removal until
# 2026-10-06 (estate review, SEC-2). Their reader was the workflow's
# dispatch-only `--inspect`; with the workflow gone,
# `apply-computed-sortdate.mjs --inspect` runs locally under the operator's
# own sign-in, so the grants had no consumer and contradicted ADR 0025's
# "CI holds no Cosmos data-plane role". They are gone; the Function App's
# own identity is the only principal with a Cosmos data-plane role
# (func_cosmos in cosmos.tf).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# REMOVED 2026-08-24 — the production-import grants, and the gate that held them
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Three role assignments and var.migration_writer_enabled went together:
#
#   github_deploy_cosmos_migration          Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor
#                                           at DATABASE scope, dbs/hcw
#   github_deploy_content_blob_migration    Storage Blob Data Contributor on the
#                                           production content account
#   github_deploy_content_network_migration Storage Account Contributor on the
#                                           production content account
#
# The owner confirmed the migration rehearsal is finished. This is a REVOCATION,
# not a tidy-up: all three were live on the identity, so a CI principal held
# write access to every container in the production database and to the account
# holding the site's media, for a job that no longer exists.
#
# WHY THE DECLARATIONS ARE DELETED RATHER THAN LEFT AT count = 0. A variable gate
# is only "off" while the workspace agrees with the checked-in default, and here
# it demonstrably did not: variables.tf said false while all three assignments
# were live in Azure. Deleting the resources removes the configuration's ability
# to grant them at all — a workspace value for a variable that no longer exists
# is a warning, not a re-grant. It also means an apply that finds them in state
# destroys them, which a default nobody can see from here would not guarantee.
#
# WHAT SURVIVES, and the job each one is still doing:
#
#   github_deploy_functions                Website Contributor on the Function
#                                          App — deploy-functions.yml publishes.
#   github_deploy_releases                 Blob Data Contributor on the FUNCTIONS
#                                          host account only, for the deployment
#                                          package. Never the content account.
#   github_deploy_funcsa_network           Storage Account Contributor on the
#                                          FUNCTIONS host account only, for the
#                                          per-run firewall window.
#   github_deploy_cosmos_content           data-plane Data Contributor scoped to
#   github_deploy_cosmos_blogs             colls/content and colls/blogs, for
#                                          apply-computed-sortdate --inspect.
#
# (github_deploy_cosmos_container_writer, the custom container-definition role
# that sat in this list for the healer's ARM PUT, was removed in #816 part 2.)
#
# The two container-scoped Cosmos grants are UNAFFECTED by dropping the
# database-scoped one. They are separate assignments; the database scope was a
# superset sitting alongside them, not their parent. The identity kept data-plane
# access to exactly the two containers the healer read, and lost everything else.
#
# The two storage grants had no consumer to lose. Nothing in .github/workflows
# addresses the content storage account, and scripts/apply-computed-sortdate.mjs
# imports @azure/cosmos and @azure/identity and no blob client at all.
#
# REMOVED 2026-08-26, one cleanup later: the two `data-migration` federated
# credentials that used to sit near the top of this file. They were held back
# from this pass because retiring a trust relationship is an identity change
# rather than a Terraform cleanup, and that decision was the owner's to make
# (T-524). It was made on 2026-08-26 and the pair is gone; the reasoning is
# recorded where they used to be declared.

# the deploy identity names `environment: production` and presents the
# environment form. Which identity a job reaches is decided by the client-id
# it presents, so check whether it sent CLIENT_ID or READER_CLIENT_ID.
