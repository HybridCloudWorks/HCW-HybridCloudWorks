#   - Azure Storage Account + containers (content and media)
#   - Azure Function App on Consumption plan (API and workers)

#   - Budget alerts (replaces GCP billing export + budget)
#   - Cloudflare DNS records for Azure services

# NOTE: User authentication is implemented by Microsoft Entra ID in the

# Resource Group
# =============================================================================
# Resource groups are the lifecycle and RBAC boundary, and each one names the
# Azure service category it groups (Naming-Convention wiki page). The split is
# drawn on destroy semantics, not on inventory: `web` is redeployable, and
# everything carrying prevent_destroy is kept out of it, because a group is
# what someone deletes when they mean "remove the app" and lifecycle
# protection on one resource must not block routine work on another.
