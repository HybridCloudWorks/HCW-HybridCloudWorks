# Offline contract tests for the adoption plan (#661). Run with
# `terraform init -backend=false && terraform test` in infra-lab/; CI runs them
# in .github/workflows/iac-validate.yml. No credential and no network call: both
# providers are mocked, and the adopted server's state is supplied by
# override_resource, because Terraform refuses to import from a mock provider.
#
# What these prove is the configuration's logic: the guards fire, the key path
# is off by default, the four names are the ones Caddy and Coder expect. What
# they cannot prove is the real provider's behaviour against the real server,
# which only the owner's first plan in hcw-lab shows (infra-lab/README.md,
# step 4).
