    //
    // A jsdom per test file, 172 of them, was half this suite's tracked time:
    // 84.6 s wall clock with the environment at 50%. vmThreads builds one V8
    // context per worker and reuses it, which runs the same 2,272 tests in
    // 25.0 s on the same 4-core machine. CI pays this twice — the `frontend`
    // job and `coverage (qlty)` — and coverage drops 100 s to 55 s.
    //
    // WHY NOT `isolate: false`, WHICH VITEST SUGGESTS IN THE SAME BREATH. The
    // two are not the same trade, and the difference is the whole decision.
    // Measured with two test files, one mutating a shared module object and
    // setting a global, the other reporting what it inherited: under
    // `isolate: false`, once both landed in one worker, the second file saw
    // the mutation and the global. Module state crosses file boundaries there.
    // That is exactly the bug #640 was filed as — passing alone, failing in a
    // full run — and it would be nondeterministic, since whether two files
    // share a worker is a scheduling detail. vmThreads keeps per-file
    // isolation: the same probe in the same worker saw a fresh module registry
    // and no global. Speed is not worth manufacturing the bug this repository
    // has just finished proving it does not have.
    //
    // WHAT IT COST, and where it was paid. A VM context has no web-stream
    // globals and its `window.location` is non-configurable. Both were handled
    // in the places that were wrong anyway (#645): setupTests.js states the
    // streams a browser provides, scripts/audit-published-pages.test.js asks
    // for the node environment it always needed, and AuthCallbackPage.test.jsx
    // uses a real URL rather than a fabricated Location. None of the three is
    // a workaround for this pool.
    //
    // Coverage was checked, not assumed, and the check is worth stating
    // precisely. Statements, branches, functions and lines come out identical
    // under both pools, to the same numerators and denominators. The two
    // lcov.info files are NOT byte-identical: they carry the same 36,985
    // records, none present in one and missing from the other, but 398 differ
    // in HIT COUNT — `DA:34,475` against `DA:34,476`. Not one record flips
    // covered to uncovered or back, which is why the percentages match exactly
    // and why the Qlty upload below reports what it did before: it gates on
    // coverage status, not on how many times a covered line ran.

    // coverage on a loaded machine, CertDetailPage.test.jsx's walk over every

    // holding that one test up. They stay on the coverage script, so `npm test`
