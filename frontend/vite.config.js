 * Entra variables unset succeeded and shipped a sign-in page pointed at every
 * Entra tenant on earth plus personal Microsoft accounts. The backend has had
 * this instinct since it was written — `verify-token.js` refuses to start
 * without its two settings, and `infra/variables.tf` rejects an empty audience
 * because an empty one SILENTLY DISABLES audience validation. The client half
 * never got it.
 *
 * SHAPE, NOT PRESENCE. A presence check would have caught neither live failure
 * mode: `.env.example` recommended `common` for the tenant and `.default` for
 * the scope, so the values most likely to be pasted in are non-empty and wrong.
 * A GUID test rejects empty, `common`, `organizations` and `consumers` in one
 * rule.
 *
 * EVERY PROBLEM AT ONCE. Throwing on the first means three deploy attempts to
 * learn about three missing variables.
 *
 * Exported so it can be tested directly. Do NOT test this by invoking the
 * config factory: that calls `loadEnv(mode, process.cwd(), '')`, so a
 * developer's local `frontend/.env` would leak into the assertion and the
 * result would depend on whose machine it ran on.
