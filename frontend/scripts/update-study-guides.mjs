/**
 * Refresh the outlines in src/data/azure/study-guides/ from Microsoft Learn
 * (#498) — one module per guide plus an index (#500; the layout, and why, is
 * in scripts/study-guide-files.mjs).
 *
 * For every Azure certification in src/data/azure/certifications.js that
 * carries a `studyGuideUrl` and is not retired, fetch the official study guide
 * and parse its "Skills measured" section into weighted areas, sub-headings
 * and objectives — the table of contents the certification detail page
 * renders, with each area deep-linked to its heading on Microsoft Learn.
 *
 * WHY STATIC DATA, NOT A RUNTIME FETCH. The Listen & Learn generator already
 * parses these guides (functions/src/lib/listen-and-learn/studyguide.js) and
 * this script reuses that parser rather than writing a second one. But the
 * generator only runs when the owner generates a certification's episodes,
 * and on 2026-09-11 exactly one Azure certification had ever been generated.
 * An outline that existed only after a generation run would be missing from
 * nearly every page. So the outline ships as data, like the catalogue: it is
 * in the prerendered HTML for crawlers and readers with JavaScript off, it is
 * versioned, and its freshness is a date the page can print and a test can
 * check.
 *
 * Run by hand with `npm run data:update:study-guides`, and every Monday by
 * .github/workflows/update-learn-catalogue.yml (#499), which stages the
 * catalogue file and this directory by path and nothing else.
 *
 * The same three rules as update-applied-skills.mjs, because the failure
 * modes are the same:
 *
 *   1. Every run stamps today's date into `DATA_AS_OF` and the header line.
 *   2. If NO guide parses, the file is not written and the run exits 1 with
 *      one plain sentence. A guide that fails on its own — a retired exam
 *      redirects to the browse page, which the parser names — is recorded
 *      per exam and does not stop the run: the previously stored outline for
 *      that exam is kept, so one bad fetch cannot erase a good outline.
 *   3. The parser is strict by design and throws rather than returning a
 *      half-parsed guide, so a layout change on Learn surfaces here as a
 *      named failure rather than as five confident, contentless sections.
 *
 * DATE IS ON THE LOCAL CALENDAR, unlike the sibling script, which stamps UTC
 * because the workflow runs on a UTC runner. The data tests compare
 * `DATA_AS_OF` against `todayIso()` from src/lib/certStatus.js, which reads
 * the local clock — and on 2026-09-10 at 23:11 CDT a UTC stamp of 2026-09-11
 * failed six tests as "in the future". Whichever machine runs this must be
 * able to run the tests on the result, so the stamp follows that machine's
 * calendar. When this moves to the cron the runner's local clock IS UTC and
 * the two agree.
 *
 * THIS IMPORTS ACROSS PACKAGES. The parser and cheerio live under functions/,
 * so `node` resolves cheerio from functions/node_modules — run `npm ci` there
 * once. No frontend script did this before; it is preferred to duplicating a
 * parser that was verified against live AZ-104, AZ-305 and GH-500 pages.
