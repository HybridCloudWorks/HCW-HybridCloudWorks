/**
 * Pre-render the built SPA to real HTML, one file per route (TODO.md T-515).
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG. This repository built with `vite build` and shipped a single
 * `index.html` containing an empty `<div id="root">` and the title "Hybrid Cloud
 * Works". Site-Main, the site being migrated from, built with Vike and shipped
 * pre-rendered HTML. Measured on the same path during the §6 parallel run:
 * `/about` was 24,902 bytes on Firebase and 2,808 bytes on Azure, with 2,717
 * characters of visible text against 967, and the correct `<title>` against a
 * generic one. Migration-Plan §7 states a gate of "90 HTML documents
 * pre-rendered"; this build produced three.
 *
 * That matters here more than it usually would. This is a content platform
 * whose purpose is being found, and every article, framework and architecture
 * page served a generic title and an empty shell to anything that does not run
 * JavaScript — most link unfurlers, several crawlers, every social preview card.
 * The pages render correctly in a browser, so clicking through the site reveals
 * nothing at all.
 *
 * HOW. `vite build` still produces the SPA exactly as before; this runs after it
 * and adds static HTML beside it. Each route is rendered through the real
 * application — same components, same providers, same 42 pages that set their
 * own title — and written to `dist/<route>/index.html`. The client bundle is
 * untouched and still hydrates, so this is additive: if a file here were wrong,
 * the SPA underneath it still works.
 *
 * WHY NOT `renderToString`. Every route is a `React.lazy` import behind one
 * `<Suspense>`, and `renderToString` does not wait for those — it emits the
 * loading fallback and returns, producing ~380 characters of identical markup
 * for every URL. `prerenderToNodeStream` (React 19's static API) resolves every
 * boundary first.
 *
 * WHY NO ARTICLE PAGES. See `routes()` in prerender-entry.jsx: they would need
 * the API at build time, and CI cannot reach it (issue #175).
 *
 * THIS STEP FAILS THE BUILD. A route that throws, renders its error boundary, or
 * comes back suspiciously small is a broken page — and a broken page written to
 * disk looks exactly like a working one from the outside. Shipping a shell is
 * the failure this whole file exists to prevent, so it is not something to warn
 * about and continue past.

 *
 *   - The live Firebase site 301s `/about` to `/about/`, so the form Google
 *     actually resolved and indexed is the TRAILING one.
 *   - Its sitemap advertises `/about`, the non-trailing form. The two have
 *     disagreed the whole time; the sitemap is the half that is wrong.
 *   - Azure was configured `trailingSlash: "never"`, the opposite of live.
 *
 * Trailing looked right — it preserves the indexed form — and was shipped that
 * way for one deploy. It is wrong on this platform.
 *
 * `trailingSlash: "always"` in Static Web Apps applies to EVERY path, files
 * included. Measured live: `/assets/index-*.js`, `/assets/vendor-*.css`,
 * `/icons/hcw-logo.png` and `/sitemap.xml` all returned 301 to a slashed URL.
 * They resolve at the redirect with the correct content type, so nothing broke
 * — it simply cost an extra round trip on every asset on every page load,
 * permanently, to preserve a URL form that a 301 already handles.
 *
 * So: NON-trailing, matching `trailingSlash: "never"`. Existing trailing-form
 * inbound links redirect once and pass their equity on, which is the same
 * mechanism that made the trailing form look preferable in the first place.
 *
 * Apex, not www: every indexed URL and the sitemap use the apex.

 * React sees a mismatch against the article markup, and discards the whole
 * pre-rendered DOM — the 120 documents would be built, shipped, and thrown away
 * exactly as they were before T-714, only more expensively.
 *
 * WHY AN ATTRIBUTE AND NOT A `<script type="application/json" id="...">`
 * ISLAND, which is the usual shape for this (it is what Next.js does with
 * `__NEXT_DATA__`). An island is found with `document.getElementById`, and
 * `getElementById` returns the FIRST element with that id in document order —
 * any element, not just a script. Article bodies are author-written HTML
 * rendered through `DOMPurify.sanitize`, and DOMPurify's default configuration
 * keeps `id` attributes on ordinary elements: it strips an injected
 * `<script id="__PRERENDER_DATA__">` but passes an injected
 * `<div id="__PRERENDER_DATA__">` through untouched. That div sits inside
 * `#root`, so it comes first, and it would have become the seed for its own
 * page — an author-controlled object flowing into every `href` and `src` on it.
 * That is not theoretical: it was reproduced against this repo's DOMPurify
 * before this attribute replaced the island.
 *
 * `src/lib/sanitizeHtml.js` now prefixes author-written ids as well, so the
 * clobber is closed at the sanitizer too. This attribute stays regardless: it
 * does not depend on that configuration staying right, which was the point.
 *
 * The mount point cannot be shadowed the same way. `<div id="root">` is written
 * by the template, ahead of everything the pre-render puts inside it, so an
 * injected `id="root"` is always later in document order and always loses. The
 * seed therefore stops depending on a sanitizer's configuration staying right.
 *
 * `escapeAttr` handles the quoting, and it escapes `<` as well as `&` and `"`,
 * so a literal `</script>` or `<img onerror=...>` inside article text is inert
 * markup-wise — it is attribute text that only ever reaches `JSON.parse`.
