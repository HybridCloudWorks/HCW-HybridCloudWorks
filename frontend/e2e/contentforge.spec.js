/**
 * The admin shell, as a visitor who has not signed in sees it.
 *
 * Until 2026-10-06 this file held sixteen tests that could not fail: every
 * assertion short-circuited on `page.url().includes('admin')`, so a blank
 * shell, a removed auth guard or a broken route all passed (estate review,
 * finding QA-1). No test here signs in; what this file pins is the one journey
 * every admin starts with and the one an attacker would probe:
 *
 *   - an unauthenticated visit to any admin route shows the sign-in card and
 *     NOTHING of the admin: no navigation, no page, no data;
 *   - the sign-in card is reachable by keyboard and named for a screen reader;
 *   - the admin route carries a document title (WCAG 2.4.2);
 *   - at a phone width the page does not scroll sideways (AP-F1).
 *
 * The signed-in journey lives in admin-authenticated.spec.js, behind the
 * credential-free identity in fixtures/entra.js: the callback landing on the
 * route that was asked for, the denial and configuration cards, the one
 * automatic re-authentication on an expired token, and the Pixel 5 drawer.
 *
 * `/admin/platform`, not `/admin/platform-settings`: the second is not a route
 * (the router answers it with its not-found page), and a signed-out check on it
 * proved only that the guard wraps unknown admin paths too.
