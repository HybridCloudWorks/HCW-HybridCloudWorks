/**
 * Does hydration actually reuse the pre-rendered DOM? (T-714)
 *
 * The 104 pre-rendered documents were built, shipped and discarded at boot for
 * as long as main.jsx used createRoot. Switching to hydrateRoot is only worth
 * anything if the client's first render matches what the pre-renderer emitted —
 * and a mismatch is SILENT in a production build, because React recovers by
 * throwing the markup away and client-rendering. The page looks right either
 * way. That is precisely why this is checked by driving a browser rather than
 * by reading the code.
 *
 * Two independent signals, because either alone can lie:
 *
 *   1. onRecoverableError in main.jsx logs '[hydration]'. React calls it for a
 *      mismatch even in production. Nothing else in the app emits that prefix.
 *   2. A node identity check. Before hydration the mount point holds server
 *      markup; if React discarded and re-rendered, the element is replaced.
 *      Tagging a node and finding it still attached afterwards proves reuse
 *      rather than coincidental sameness of the HTML.
