 * is the usual shape for this, and it is the shape this used to have, but it
 * is found with `document.getElementById` — which returns the first element
 * carrying that id, of any kind. Article bodies are author-written HTML, and
 * DOMPurify's DEFAULT configuration strips an injected `<script>` but keeps
 * `<div id="...">`; such a div sits inside `#root`, so it comes first in
 * document order and would have supplied the seed for its own page. `<div
 * id="root">` comes from the template, ahead of everything the pre-render puts
 * inside it, so nothing an author writes can precede it.
 * scripts/prerender.mjs writes the matching attribute and says the same there.
 *
 * `src/lib/sanitizeHtml.js` now also prefixes author ids, so the clobber is
 * closed on both sides. Neither fix is redundant: this one holds even if the
 * sanitizer is reconfigured, and that one holds for every id the app looks up,
 * not just this one.
 *
 * A malformed value is treated as absent rather than fatal. It would mean the
 * build wrote something JSON.parse rejects, which is a build bug — but taking
 * the whole site down in the browser is a strictly worse response than
 * rendering it the way it rendered before any of this existed.

 * against the home page's DOM on every one of them.
