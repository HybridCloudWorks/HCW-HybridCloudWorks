/**
 * proxyEnvelope.js - reading what `publerProxy`, `klaviyoProxy` and
 * `linkieProxy` actually return.
 *
 * THE PROXIES ANSWER HTTP 200 FOR EVERY OUTCOME. `authedFetch` throws on a
 * non-2xx status, so most calls in this app can treat "it resolved" as "it
 * worked" - but not these three. A refused credential, a 404 upstream and a
 * gateway error all arrive here as a RESOLVED promise carrying
 * `{ ok: false, status, data }`, and the only signal is `ok`.
 *
 * Three "Test Connection" runners on the Integrations page did not check it.
 * `testPubler` read `Array.isArray(accounts)` on the envelope - which is an
 * object and never an array - so it computed zero and reported
 * "Connected - 0 social account(s)" for every outcome including a 403. The
 * button said Connected while the timer beside it had been failing for hours,
 * which is worse than having no button: it is the same defect as #463 item 1,
 * one layer up, and this module exists so it cannot be written a fourth time.
 *
 * Mirrors `functions/src/lib/integrations/upstream-error.js`, deliberately
 * rather than importing it: that module ships in the Functions bundle and this
 * one in the browser's.
