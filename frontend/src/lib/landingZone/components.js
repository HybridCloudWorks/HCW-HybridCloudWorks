/**
 * The Landing Zone Builder's catalogue (#667): the eight components a learner
 * assembles, what each one teaches, which module deploys it, what it depends
 * on, and the knobs it exposes.
 *
 * Two groups. `platform` is what the organisation runs once: the management
 * group tree, the policy baseline, central logging, the hub network, the
 * firewall in it, and identity. `application` is what teams get, N times:
 * corp landing zones (reached through the hub) and online landing zones
 * (internet-facing). The names are the ones HashiCorp's validated pattern and
 * the `alz` architecture definition use, so a learner who reads on meets the
 * same words.
 *
 * `teaches` is the hand-written explanation, three to five sentences a
 * beginner reads: what the thing is, why a landing zone has it, and what
 * breaks without it. `avm` is the Azure Verified Module that deploys the
 * component, or null when the component is configuration of another
 * module's call (policy sits inside avm-ptn-alz; the firewall is a block of
 * the connectivity module). A landing zone, identity included, is a
 * subscription placed in the tree by avm-ptn-alz plus a spoke virtual
 * network from the virtual network module, peered to the hub. Every `avm`
 * comes from avmVersions.js so the catalogue and the pins cannot disagree.
