/**
 * Landing Zone Builder, Phase 1 (#667, epic #657): the logic behind "build an
 * Azure landing zone component by component and read the Terraform it
 * becomes", with no page yet. Mirrors pricingScenarios/: pure functions,
 * frozen catalogues, the state as a value and as a URL.
 *
 * PURE. No React, no DOM, no clock, no network. The input is a state
 * `{ selected, options }`; the outputs are plain objects, strings and
 * `{ path, content }` files. Nothing here talks to a tenant, and the README
 * every emission carries says so.
 *
 * One module per concern, this file the public surface:
 *   components.js   the eight components, what each teaches, its knobs
 *   avmVersions.js  the four Azure Verified Modules, pinned and dated
 *   cidr.js         the address arithmetic behind hub and spokes
 *   state.js        normalisation and the dependency rule
 *   share.js        the build as a query string
 *   hcl/            the build as Terraform files, one module per file
 *   diagram.js      the build as a laid-out tree
