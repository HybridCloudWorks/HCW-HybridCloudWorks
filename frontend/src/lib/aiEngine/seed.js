 * though the router dropped it at the port (Vertex authenticates with GCP
 * Application Default Credentials, which a Function App cannot hold); OpenAI was
 * in DEPRECATED_PROVIDERS and deleted on sight though the router calls it; and
 * Perplexity, Bedrock and Replicate were offered though nothing routes text to
 * them. Reading this page told you the opposite of what the API would do.
 *
 * It is now the same providers as `functions/src/lib/ai/router.js`, in the
 * same order, and `aiEngine.test.js` fails if the two lists diverge. The
 * fourth, NVIDIA (#701), is also placed per feature — see getAiFeatures.
 *
 * Order is cost, not quality — see DEFAULT_PROVIDER_ORDER in ai-config.js. These
 * are seed values only: `order` and `enabled` are the administrator's to change
 * from this page, and the API honours both on every call.
 *
 * NO MODEL LISTS HERE (ADR 0034 slice 2, #857). Each card's models come from
 * the model catalogue the API refreshes weekly from the providers' own list
 * endpoints (`cms/ai-model-catalog`, merged onto the cards by
 * aiEngine/catalog.js). A list typed in here was a copy that went stale the
 * way the provider list once did, and `aiEngine.test.js` refuses one. A
 * stored document from before that day may still carry a `models` array;
 * the page ignores it. `defaultModel` stays the seed's: a pin the router's
 * own table serves, read once by the migration into the Priority list's
 * per-row model (ADR 0034 §6); since slice 4 (#859) the cards show no pin
 * and the Priority row names the model instead.
 *
 * Replicate has NOT gone away — it generates article cover images, reached
 * directly through REPLICATE_API_KEY. It was never a text provider, and listing
 * it as one is what made this page confusing.
