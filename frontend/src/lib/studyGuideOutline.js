/**
 * Load one Azure study-guide outline on demand (#500).
 *
 * WHY. The outlines used to be one 491 kB module imported by the Azure
 * certification detail page, so every detail page shipped all of them (74 kB
 * gzipped) to render one — which was already in its prerendered HTML. Each
 * guide is now its own module under src/data/azure/study-guides/, and
 * `import.meta.glob` below makes Vite emit one small chunk per guide. The
 * page downloads only the guide it shows.
 *
 * WHY `use()` WITH A CACHED THENABLE, NOT `React.lazy`. Both suspend, and both
 * are hydration-safe inside a <Suspense> boundary for the same reason (see the
 * detail page's SkillsMeasured). The difference is what is being loaded:
 *
 *   - `React.lazy` loads a COMPONENT. A guide module is data, so lazy would
 *     need a synthetic component per exam wrapping the outline, itself cached
 *     per key so that a re-render does not create a new lazy type — which
 *     would remount the subtree and re-suspend on every render.
 *   - `use()` (React 19, which this app runs: react ^19.3.0) reads a promise
 *     directly. The promise must be stable across renders or React warns
 *     about an uncached promise and suspends again each time, so it is cached
 *     here per exam key for the life of the page.
 *
 * The thenable is also stamped `status: 'fulfilled'` / `value` once it
 * settles. That is React's own thenable protocol: `use()` on a thenable that
 * already says fulfilled returns the value synchronously instead of
 * suspending, so a second visit to an exam in the same session renders its
 * outline in one pass with no fallback frame.
 *
 * The prerenderer needs nothing special: react-dom/static's
 * `prerenderToNodeStream` waits for every suspended boundary before it
 * completes (the same mechanism that renders the lazy route pages), and
 * prerender-entry.jsx's `progressiveChunkSize` keeps the finished boundary
 * inline — prerender.mjs's findStreamedBoundary gate refuses the build if not.
