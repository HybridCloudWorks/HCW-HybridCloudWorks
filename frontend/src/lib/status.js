/**
 * One status vocabulary for the whole admin (ADR 0033 §2).
 *
 * Until 2026-10-03 five surfaces used five vocabularies — PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN,
 * connected/error/untested, Broken/Not configured/Working, failed/degraded,
 * OPERATIONAL/REGIONAL — for the same five situations. A reader learning one
 * page learned nothing about the next. This module names the situations once:
 *
 *   SYSTEM_STATUS   how a dependency, probe or integration is doing
 *   CONTENT_STATUS  where a piece of content is in the pipeline, as a person
 *                   reads it (the stored ids are content-status.js's)
 *
 * Both carry a tone (ok / warn / bad / down / off / muted) the StatusBadge
 * turns into colour AND an icon, so colour is never the only signal.
 *
 * Every other status table in the admin (speaking, ambassador, chapter) is
 * built by `statusTable` below, so the record shape — `{ id, label, tone,
 * help }` — is written once and a badge can read any of them.
 *
 * ## The system status model (#1010, #1011)
 *
 * Five states, and the rules for moving between them, are written here and
 * nowhere else in the frontend. The server keeps one mirror for the health
 * pulse (functions/src/lib/health/status-model.js), and
 * pages/admin/health/statusParity.test.js fails if the two disagree on an id,
 * a window or a classification.
 *
 *   healthy   it answered and every check passed
 *   degraded  it answered, but slower, partly, or with a warning count above zero
 *   critical  it answered, but said no: a setting or key is wrong or missing,
 *             a credential was refused, or the check itself fails
 *   offline   it could not be reached at all (a network error, a timeout, a
 *             502, 503 or 504), or it has been silent past its heartbeat window
 *   unknown   never checked, or the last check is older than its freshness
 *             window: stale. The last value and its age are still shown.
 *
 * Until 2026-10-08 critical was `misconfigured` and offline was `unavailable`.
 * `toSystemStatus` still reads both words (LEGACY_SYSTEM_IDS), so a stored
 * result or an older caller keeps working.
 *
 * TRANSITIONS
 *
 *   - Only a check that ran moves a result to healthy, degraded, critical or
 *     offline: a probe, a Test button, or the server-side pulse. When a check
 *     fails, `classifyFailure` decides between critical and offline.
 *   - A result becomes unknown when it ages past `freshnessWindow` for its
 *     probe, and comes back the moment a newer check lands.
 *   - A heartbeat (the pulse itself, a lab agent) is offline after MISSED_BEATS
 *     missed beats in a row. That is three, the rule the lab agents' 90 s
 *     window (3 × 30 s) already used.
