/**
 * Entra ID auth core — the MSAL replacement for firebase/auth.
 *
 * One instance, one initialize, and three jobs:
 *   - session state: getCurrentUser / onAuthStateChanged (MSAL events)
 *   - interactive sign-in/out (popup with redirect fallback — the tenant owns
 *     MFA, so the Firebase MFA/reCAPTCHA machinery has no equivalent here on
 *     purpose; see the note below on which tenant mechanism)
 *   - API tokens: acquireApiToken() returns an access token whose audience
 *     is the backend's ENTRA_API_AUDIENCE (via VITE_ENTRA_API_SCOPE) —
 *     silent first, interactive only when MSAL says it must be.
 *
 * MFA IS SECURITY DEFAULTS, NOT CONDITIONAL ACCESS. Verified against the
 * tenant on 2026-09-12: security defaults are enabled in tenant properties, and
 * Conditional Access is unavailable because the tenant is not licensed for it
 * (Entra ID P1). This comment used to say Conditional Access, which was wrong
 * and would have sent anyone looking for a policy to an empty blade.
 *
 * The difference matters in one direction: security defaults cannot be scoped
 * or excepted, and Entra DISABLES them automatically the moment any Conditional
 * Access policy is created. So the day this tenant is licensed and someone
 * writes their first policy, MFA silently stops being enforced everywhere it
 * was — unless that policy covers it. Either way the SPA never sees a second
 * factor; it is enforced inside the Microsoft sign-in.
 *
 * The user shape mirrors what the Firebase code exposed (uid/email/
 * displayName) so consumers don't churn: uid is the Entra object id, which
 * is exactly what the backend's admins/{oid} registry keys on.

 * Redirect is the default. Popup is opt-in and, right now, nothing opts in.

 *
 * Observed on Edge/Windows against www.hybridcloudworks.com on 2026-08-23:
 * `loginPopup()` opened a TOP-LEVEL WINDOW rather than a child popup. Entra
 * authenticated, the code came back to the redirect URI, and the opener sat
 * waiting on a window handle it no longer had. After #196 taught the root page
 * to consume the fragment, the token was written to localStorage — where the
 * opener could have read it — and the opener still waited, because nothing
 * tells `loginPopup()` that its promise has been settled elsewhere.
 *
 * That is not a bug to work around with cross-window messaging. The popup flow
 * has one failure mode that no amount of care on our side removes: the browser
 * decides what `window.open` produces, and if it produces a top-level window
 * the handshake is gone.
 *
 * Redirect has no handshake. One window navigates to Entra, comes back with the
 * code, `handleRedirectPromise()` consumes it, and MSAL returns the user to the
 * page they started from. The cost is losing in-page state across the
 * navigation, which for a sign-in on an admin route is nothing.

/**
 * Idempotent: first caller initializes and drains any redirect response.
 *
 * A REJECTION IS NOT CACHED. `initPromise` memoises the in-flight
 * initialisation so concurrent callers share one MSAL init — but memoising a
 * *failure* means one bad redirect response poisons every later call for the
 * life of the page, and the only way out is a manual reload. `handleRedirectPromise`
 * rejects on things that genuinely recur on mobile: an interrupted redirect, a
 * consent error in the hash, `interaction_in_progress` from a double-tap. So a
 * failed attempt clears the memo and lets the next caller try again.

 * than rejecting, so the `.catch()` never runs and the fallback never fires.
 * Sign-out silently did nothing. Seen on 2026-08-23 as a return to

 *
 * The behaviour being migrated from is the reason to prefer local. Site-Main's

 * application's own session and returns immediately. It does not navigate, and
 * it does not end the Google SSO session either; the identity provider's cookie
 * survives and the next sign-in is quick. `clearCache()` is the same contract:
 * this app's session is gone, the Entra session is not.

 * `logoutRedirect()`, which navigates the whole tab to Microsoft and back and
 * would sign the user out of every other Microsoft property in the browser —
 * strictly more than Firebase ever did, and more than a "Sign out" button on
