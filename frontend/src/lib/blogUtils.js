 * published-pages audit reported a broken image. Re-hosting the file (#374)
 * moves it to our own storage and changes nothing: a video in an `<img>` does
 * not render from any origin. The same feed will do this again, so the test
 * is on the media type, never on that one URL.
 *
 * The test reads the **path**, not the whole string, because a query string
