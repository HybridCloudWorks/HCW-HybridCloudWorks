/**
 * Cloudflare Turnstile, for exactly one control: the Landing Zone Builder's
 * "Validate on the lab" (ADR 0032 decision 6, revised 2026-09-28). The lab
 * takes a public job only from the builder's pane on the site, and the token
 * this widget issues is half of how the server knows it came from there; the
 * request's Origin is the other half (functions/src/lib/labs/public-lock.js).
 *
 * LOADED ON DEMAND, NOWHERE ELSE. Nothing imports Cloudflare's script at
 * build time and no page but the builder calls `loadTurnstile`, which the
 * builder does only once the server says the lab is open. So every other page
 * makes no request to challenges.cloudflare.com, and the CSP grants that
 * origin `script-src` and `frame-src` and nothing more
 * (staticwebapp.config.json, held by csp.test.js).
 *
 * THE SITE KEY IS PUBLIC. It is in the bundle by design, a build-time
 * variable read from the repository variable VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY
 * (deploy-azure-frontend.yml). The secret half is the server's, in Key Vault.
 * An empty key means this build cannot run the check, and the button says so.
 * Cloudflare publishes test site keys for local work
 * (developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/troubleshooting/testing/); the server
 * still accepts a token only for the site's own hostnames.
