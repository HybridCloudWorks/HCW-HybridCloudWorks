/**
 * The FinOps reference architectures this page renders whatever the content
 * API returns.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE. These blueprints used to be declared inside
 * finops/ArchitecturePage.jsx, which made "can this page be empty?" a question
 * only a human reading JSX could answer — and the sitemap has to answer it at
 * build time. `/vmware/architecture-designs` was advertised while rendering
 * nothing (issue #373) precisely because the pre-render could not tell a
 * provider with hardcoded blueprints from one without.
 *
 * So the answer moves somewhere a build script can read it. `sitemapRoutes` in
 * frontend/scripts/prerender.mjs imports every `architecture-blueprints.js`
 * under src/pages and counts what it exports; a provider whose module is empty
 * AND whose API count is zero has an empty page and loses its sitemap entry.
 * Nothing restates the count, so adding or removing a blueprint here is
 * immediately true for the sitemap as well as for the page.
 *
 * Plain data, no JSX and no `@/` imports, because that build script imports
 * this file directly in Node with no bundler and no alias resolution.
