/**
 * The Cloudflare Turnstile widget on the builder's pane, for "Validate on
 * the lab" (ADR 0032 decision 6, revised 2026-09-28). The server takes a
 * public job only with a token this widget issued for the `lab-validate`
 * action on the site (functions/src/lib/labs/public-lock.js).
 *
 * ONLY WHILE THE LAB IS OPEN. `active` is the caller's "the server said open
 * and this build has a site key"; until it is true nothing loads, so a closed
 * lab, and every other page, never contacts Cloudflare. When it turns false
 * (a refusal shut the door, or the control unmounted) the widget is removed.
 *
 * MANAGED MODE, SEEN ONLY WHEN NEEDED. The widget's mode is the dashboard's
 * (Managed); `appearance: 'interaction-only'` keeps it invisible unless
 * Cloudflare wants the visitor to act, when it appears in the container below
 * the button and the line beside the button says so.
 *
 * ONE TOKEN PER SUBMISSION. A token is single use and lives five minutes.
 * Cloudflare refreshes an expired one by itself (`refresh-expired` defaults
 * to `auto`), `take()` hands the current one over exactly once, and `renew()`
 * asks for a fresh one after the submission answered, whatever it answered,
 * because the server spent the old one at siteverify.
 *
 * `phase` is what the line reads: `idle` (not active), `loading` (the script
 * is loading or the check is running), `interactive` (Cloudflare wants the
 * visitor), `ready` (a token is held), `spent` (handed to a submission), or
 * `error` (the script or the check failed; Cloudflare retries by itself).
 * `containerRef` goes on the element the widget draws into, which the caller
 * renders whenever `active` is true.
