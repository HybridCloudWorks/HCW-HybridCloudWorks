/**
 * The callback page's two jobs when things go wrong (#520).
 *
 * It succeeds by navigating away, so there is little to assert on the happy
 * path. The failure path is where it earns its tests: an authorization code
 * must not survive in the address bar, and MSAL's own error text must not reach
 * the screen.
 *
 * A REAL LOCATION AT A REAL URL, NOT A FABRICATED ONE (#645). This file used to
 * redefine `window.location` with a hand-built object, because the page reads
 * `pathname`, `search` and `hash` and calls `replace`. That cost two bugs — a
 * spread that silently dropped `pathname` and `search`, since jsdom puts them
 * on the prototype, and a redefinition left in place that leaked a crippled
 * `location` into every later file in the same worker — and it only worked at
 * all while `window.location` was configurable, which is true under vitest's
 * `forks` pool and false under `vmThreads`.
 *
 * So the environment provides the URL instead, through the docblock below, and
 * every read the page makes is a real `Location` parsing a real address. The
 * one thing that still cannot be observed, `location.replace`, is reached
 * through `@/lib/hardNavigate` and mocked there.
 *
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 * @vitest-environment-options { "url": "https://example.test/auth/callback#code=1.AUYA-secret-authorization-code&state=abc" }
