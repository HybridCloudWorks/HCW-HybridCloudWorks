/**
 * Certifications Hub (route `/admin/certifications`) — CRUD for the
 * `certifications` container (via the cms/certifications API) that powers the
 * About page.
 *
 * Until #572 this was one list with an all / featured / expiring / hidden
 * toggle. It now has a tab per duty, at the Newsletter Hub's standard
 * (components/admin/certifications):
 *
 *   Catalog     every cert: stats, search, the issuer filter, add and edit
 *   Featured    what Spotlight leads with, in display order
 *   Renewals    expired and expiring certs with due dates, and what the
 *               Sunday re-verify timer does about them
 *   Publishing  the public snapshot, when it was last published, what changed
 *               since, and Publish snapshot
 *   Settings    image rules, the verification source, the hidden-items list
 *
 * Deep links are `?tab=`; the old view ids (all, featured, expiring, hidden)
 * and anything unknown land where their content went (certifications/tabs.js).
 *
 * The certification list is read once, here on the page, because four tabs
 * show it and an edit on one must be on all of them (useCertifications, with
 * its generation guard and per-cert in-flight guard). Each of those tabs
 * renders the list's loading and error state in place of its own content;
 * Publishing reads its own snapshot while it is open. The header and tab bar
 * always render. The editor and the delete confirmation live here too, so any
 * tab's card can open them.
