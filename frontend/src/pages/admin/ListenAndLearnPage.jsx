/**
 * Listen & Learn (route `/admin/listen-and-learn`) — the Audio Library
 * (ADR 0033 §4): books and courses, their chapters and lessons, and each
 * chapter's audio versions, generated as drafts and published only on
 * approval.
 *
 * Four tabs by duty (components/admin/listen-and-learn):
 *
 *   Library    every book and course; open one for its chapters, where a
 *              chapter is reordered, regenerated, versioned, renamed,
 *              archived, deleted, approved or withdrawn
 *   Generate   run a certification's study guide into a course, grounded on
 *              owner-supplied pages and videos (#433), with the expected
 *              speech spend
 *   Review     the chapters of one book that are not live, with transcripts
 *              and a player, and the approval that publishes them
 *   Settings   the voice default and its cost, the voices, where audio
 *              lives, and the providers behind it
 *
 * Deep links are `?tab=`; the old tab and section words (published, sets,
 * episodes, voice, grounding) and anything unknown land where their content
 * went (listen-and-learn/tabs.js). `?platform=&exam=` opens that book, and
 * `&chapter=` rings one of its chapters — the dashboard's Decision Center
 * links a chapter awaiting review as `?tab=review&platform&exam&chapter`.
 *
 * The books and the open book's chapters are read once, here on the page,
 * because Library and Review both show them and an approval on one must be
 * on the other (useListenAndLearn, with its generation guard on reads and a
 * per-chapter in-flight guard on writes). A run keeps reporting its progress
 * while the operator is on another tab, because `generating` and `progress`
 * live in the hook rather than in the Generate tab.
