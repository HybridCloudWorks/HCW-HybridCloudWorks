/**
 * Platform Settings Hub (route `/admin/platform`) — the `admin_config`
 * documents the pipeline reads on every run, one tab per concern (#571), at
 * the Newsletter Hub's level of separation (components/admin/platform-settings):
 *
 *   All settings       the index: every setting document, where it is stored,
 *                      where it is edited, and a deep link (ADR 0033 Platform)
 *   Content defaults   default covers; a link to the newsletter's own settings
 *   Content types      what an item becomes and how it became an idea (ADR 0033)
 *   Social automation  autoposting to Publer on a live publish
 *   Audio              podcast feeds and the Listen & Learn voice
 *   Reminders          dated things not to forget, said on Telegram by the daily check
 *   Change history     every save, who made it and what it recorded — including
 *                      the Sessionize speaker id saved on Integrations
 *
 * Each tab mounts only while it is open and loads its own settings, with its
 * own loading and error states, so a failure in one never blanks another.
 * Tabs deep-link with `?tab=`; an id this page does not know lands on the
 * index rather than on a blank page.
 *
 * Settings stay where the thing they configure is seen working — the Audio
 * tab, the Newsletter Hub, AI Engine, Integrations — and the index is the map.
 * There is no single provider here, so the header names none: Publer is named
 * where it is used, on Social automation.
