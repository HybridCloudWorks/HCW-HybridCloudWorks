/**
 * Health Hub (route `/admin/health`) — what is true now, and what can be
 * verified right now.
 *
 * This replaced two pages that answered halves of one question. Ops Health
 * rendered what the estate had already written down: scheduler counts, queue
 * ages, open alerts, all of it produced by timers that ran while nobody was
 * looking. Diagnostics ran checks that only exist while an admin is signed in
 * and pressing a button — the token in this session, the registry's opinion of
 * this principal, a real job submitted to the Labs queue and cancelled again.
 *
 * Neither was a page about "health" on its own. An operator with a broken
 * pipeline had to know which of the two would have the answer, and the honest
 * answer was usually "both, in that order": read the signals, then run a probe
 * to see whether the thing is broken now or merely was.
 *
 * Until #569 the merged page was one long scroll. It now has a tab per duty,
 * at the Newsletter Hub's standard (components/admin/HubTabs):
 *
 *   Overview  the strip, then one read of `getOpsHealthSnapshot`: readiness,
 *             publishing and operational signals. Reported, not asked for.
 *             Every card says when its block was read and links to Checks.
 *   Alerts    workflow alerts, filtered, with acknowledge / resolve / reopen.
 *             Its own tab because answering one is a live action.
 *   Checks    the probe registry (health/probeRegistry.js): one card per hub
 *             dependency with the same five facts each, Test all, and under
 *             it the detailed identity, smoke-test and Labs cards those
 *             probes summarise.
 *   Code and Security
 *             Qlty's grades and open issues, condensed (health/CodeQualityTab).
 *             Read the first time the tab opens, never on page load.
 *   Report    the Markdown summary of those checks and every probe's last
 *             status, plus the Code and Security summary when that tab was
 *             read, and Copy report.
 *
 * Deep links are `?tab=`; an unknown or moved id lands where its content went
 * (health/tabs.js).
 *
 * ONE VOCABULARY (ADR 0033 §2, #1010). Every verdict, signal and probe on
 * this page renders through StatusBadge with lib/status.js's five words —
 * healthy, degraded, critical, offline, unknown — the same words the
 * Integrations page uses for the same states, with the transition rules
 * (freshness windows, critical against offline, the heartbeat) written once
 * in lib/status.js. Every card shows its word in the same place, the
 * top-right of its header (health/StatusSlot.jsx).
 *
 * MEMORY AND PULSE (#1010, #1011). Every probe's last result is kept on the
 * server (health/useStoredResults.js, cms/health/probe-results): a Test run
 * here records its result, and the server's health pulse records what it can
 * check on its own every five minutes. The page reads the store on load and
 * every minute while it is visible, shows each result's age, and shows one
 * past its freshness window as unknown with its last value. The pulse line
 * above the tabs says when the pulse last beat; when it is late, the hub as a
 * whole is offline, and before it has ever beaten, unknown.
 *
 * State the tabs read lives here, on the page, not in the tabs: the snapshot
 * feeds Overview, Alerts and the snapshot probes; the identity and Labs
 * results feed the strip, Checks and Report; the probe runner's results and
 * the stored results feed Checks and Report. So switching tabs never
 * refetches or reruns a probe, and a report copied from Report is the checks
 * just run on Checks. The header and tab bar always render; a snapshot that
 * fails to load is an error on the two tabs that show it, and Checks and
 * Report carry on.
