/**
 * Social Hub (route `/admin/social`) — schedule HCW articles to LinkedIn, X,
 * Facebook, Instagram, Threads and YouTube through Publer, and see what went
 * out.
 *
 * Until #575 this was one 1,551-line component holding the Publer client, the
 * view helpers and four tabs' worth of JSX. It now has a tab per duty, at the
 * Newsletter Hub's standard (components/admin/social):
 *
 *   Compose    pick a published page, choose accounts, write the caption and
 *              schedule it — or publish it now
 *   Queue      what Publer is holding, and this hub's own records of it, each
 *              editable and movable
 *   Published  the history, by day, with the per-account outcomes Publer sent
 *   Accounts   the connected profiles and which platforms they cover
 *   Settings   whether the proxy can use its credentials, and where the rest
 *              of it is set
 *
 * Deep links are `?tab=`; the old id `settings` still lands on Settings, and
 * the words for content that moved (connection, profiles, calendar) land where
 * it went (social/tabs.js). `?contentId=` preselects a page on Compose; the
 * Calendar's Share and Schedule Social carry it.
 *
 * The header's connection state is the ACCOUNTS CALL's answer (ADR 0033
 * Amplify slice). Until 2026-10-03 it was a constant `true`, so a missing key
 * and a refused one both read as connected.
 *
 * Publer credentials are function-app settings resolved by the `publerProxy`
 * Azure Function and are never bundled into the client (FINDING-04):
 *   PUBLER_API_KEY        — Publer API key
 *   PUBLER_WORKSPACE_ID   — Publer workspace ID
