/**
 * The Health Hub's stored results and the pulse's heartbeat, kept current
 * while the page is open (#1010, #1011).
 *
 * Read on mount, then again every `pollMs` (a minute) while the tab is
 * visible, so a result the server's pulse records appears without a reload.
 * A hidden tab stops polling — nothing is looking — and reads once the moment
 * it is shown again. Every read goes through one generation counter, as the
 * ops snapshot's does (useOpsSnapshot.js): a slow read that resolves after a
 * newer one is dropped, and an unmount supersedes whatever is in flight.
 *
 * A failed read keeps the results already on screen. Unlike the snapshot's
 * counts, these carry their own times, so an old result shows its age (and
 * turns unknown past its window) rather than passing for a fresh one; wiping
 * them would put the hub back to "Not tested yet" for every probe, which is
 * the reset to defaults this store exists to end.
 *
 * `now` advances with each poll, so "checked 12 min ago" and a result going
 * stale move on screen without anything else changing.
