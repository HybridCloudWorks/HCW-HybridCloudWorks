/**
 * The Health Hub's probe registry — one entry per hub dependency, so "is
 * every part of the platform working?" is answered by one list rather than by
 * knowing which page happens to carry a test (ADR 0033 §1 Platform, §8).
 *
 * Every entry is `{ id, label, hub, covers, impact, action, href, kind, safe }`
 * plus the function that answers it (and, optionally, `freshForMs`: how long
 * its result stays evidence, when that is shorter than its kind's window),
 * and every answer is one shape:
 *
 *   { status, summary, detail?, checkedAt, checkedBy? }
 *
 * where `status` is lib/status.js's vocabulary — healthy / degraded /
 * critical / offline / unknown — so a probe here reads like a card on the
 * Integrations page and a row on the Overview tab.
 *
 * Every id here has an entry in the server's closed catalogue
 * (functions/src/lib/health/probe-catalogue.js), which decides who may record
 * its result; statusParity.test.js fails when the two lists drift.
 *
 * Three kinds, by where the answer comes from:
 *
 *   live      `run(ctx)` makes a request and returns a result. These are the
 *             tests the Integrations page already had (SERVICES[].test, run
 *             by the same function so the two pages cannot disagree), plus
 *             reads of routes other hubs expose: the AI providers list and
 *             testAiProvider, the labs snapshot, the newsletter issues, the
 *             public content list for cover images, /api/health.
 *   snapshot  `evaluate(ctx)` reads the ops-health snapshot the page already
 *             holds. Its "Test" is a re-read of the snapshot, so Test all
 *             refreshes it once and evaluates every snapshot probe from it.
 *   session   `evaluate(ctx)` reads a check the page runs with the session's
 *             own token (identity, the Labs no-op probe, the smoke tests);
 *             its "Test" is that check's own action.
 *
 * `safe` says whether Test all may press it. A probe that writes real data
 * (the smoke tests enqueue jobs and build digests; the Labs probe creates a
 * job) or spends quota (YouTube) is run from its own card only, and its
 * `costNote` says why.
 *
 * The table is written one hub per module under probeGroups/ and joined here;
 * the builders and links are probeKit.js, the pure evaluators
 * probeEvaluators.js and the live runners probeRunners.js. Everything a page
 * or a test needs is re-exported from this module, so the registry still has
 * one address.
