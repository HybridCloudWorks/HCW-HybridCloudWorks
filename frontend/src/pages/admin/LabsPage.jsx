/**
 * Labs Hub (route `/admin/labs`) — the labs the site offers and the two
 * services behind them: the Desktop a learner opens and the Agent that
 * checks their work (ADR 0033 "Labs"; the runner-only hub of #577 before).
 *
 * Six tabs by duty (components/admin/labs):
 *
 *   Catalogue  every lab, its providers, difficulty, steps, where it is
 *              published, and Validate: run its check on the runner
 *   Dashboard  is the fleet up, is anything moving, and what Agent,
 *              Desktop and Lab mean, each with its live state
 *   Jobs       every run the snapshot carries, expandable to what it printed
 *   Console    submit a job and watch it run
 *   Agents     which agents can be reached, and what to do when one cannot
 *   Settings   how a new VPS agent is provisioned
 *
 * This page validates `?tab=`, and an id that USED to be a tab goes where
 * its content went (labs/tabs.js). `?job=<id>` opens the Console on a job:
 * the Catalogue's Validate enqueues a lab's check and sends the operator
 * there to watch it.
 *
 * The snapshot is read once, here, because every tab is a view of it — and its
 * staleness clock is deliberately independent of the fetch, so that during an
 * outage `now` keeps advancing and agents stop looking connected (T-309).
