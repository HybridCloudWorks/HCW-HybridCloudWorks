/**
 * Ambassador Hub (route `/admin/ambassador`) — Spotlight (ADR 0033 §4).
 * Everything here exists to culminate in a credible application: the
 * programs worth pursuing, one application per pursuit, the evidence that
 * backs it (imported from Speaking, Certifications and Published content, or
 * added by hand), the deadlines and renewals around it, and a readiness
 * score that explains itself and never promises acceptance.
 *
 * Five tabs by duty, Settings last (components/admin/ambassador):
 *
 *   Dashboard     where every pursuit stands, what is due, what to do next
 *   Programs      the catalogue, with details, requirements and readiness
 *   Applications  the list, and the workspace for the one selected
 *   Evidence      the library, with filters and the three imports
 *   Settings      programs, requirements, evidence types, reminders, fields
 *
 * The three reads are the page's (useAmbassadorData), so switching tabs
 * never refetches and an edit on one tab is on every other. Until the
 * `ambassador` container exists the API answers NOT_PROVISIONED and the hub
 * shows that one state with the owner's plan command (§6 item 4).
