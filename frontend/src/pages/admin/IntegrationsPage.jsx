/**
 * Integrations Hub (route `/admin/integrations`) — every third-party service,
 * whether it answers, and the keys it answers with.
 *
 * It replaced two pages about one subject from opposite ends: Connections
 * could tell you Publer was refusing calls, API Keys could rotate
 * `PUBLER-API-KEY`, and neither could do the other. Until #570 the merged page
 * was one long scroll. It now has a tab per duty, at the Newsletter Hub's
 * standard (components/admin/integrations):
 *
 *   Overview  every service on one grid, broken and not-configured first, with
 *             Test all (one service at a time) and when each was last tested
 *   Services  one group at a time; each card has its test, its docs link,
 *             what it is for and where it is used, and the names and lights
 *             of the keys it uses
 *   Keys      every Key Vault credential: its light, the services that use
 *             it, paste and generate, and "Other credentials"
 *   Credentials  every credential in every store (Key Vault, GitHub, HCP
 *             Terraform, the lab host and the rest): its age, its expiry,
 *             whether anything renews it, overdue in red, and a recorded
 *             rotation date for the ones only the owner renews, which moves
 *             their Telegram reminder (#1026)
 *   Identity  the Entra configuration the browser and the API run on
 *
 * Deep links are `?tab=` (and `?group=` on Services); an unknown or moved tab
 * id lands where its content went, and `/admin/connections` and
 * `/admin/api-keys` redirect to Overview and Keys (tabs.js).
 *
 * Each tab loads its own data, with its own loading and error states, so one
 * refused request never blanks another tab or the tab bar. The session's test
 * results live here, on the page, so they survive switching tabs — and since
 * ADR 0033 each is recorded to `cms/integration-status`, so the last verdict
 * survives a reload too and the Health page can show it.
 *
 * No tab shows a credential value, masked or otherwise: the API has no read
 * path for one and the app's vault role cannot read one.
 *
 * NO ACTIVITY TAB, ON PURPOSE. Key writes record only the latest
 * `lastWriteAt`/`lastWriteBy` per key (shown on each Keys row); nothing writes
 * an audit row for a key change and there is no admin route that reads
 * `admin_audit_logs`. A history tab needs that backend first — see #570.
