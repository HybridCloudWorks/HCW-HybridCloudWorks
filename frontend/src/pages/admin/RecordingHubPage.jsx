/**
 * Recording Hub (route `/admin/recording-hub`) — the podcast pipeline, from a
 * recording to a published episode.
 *
 * Until #576 this had one tab per PROVIDER: Podcast, and Plaud with three
 * sub-tabs of its own. That made "where do I approve a transcript" depend on
 * which service produced it, and put the OAuth setup two clicks inside a
 * working tab. It is a tab per duty now, at the Newsletter Hub's standard
 * (components/admin/recording-hub):
 *
 *   Recordings    the live Plaud library, what is stored, and the two ways to
 *                 add audio — with "Script this" on each
 *   Transcripts   what the pipeline produced, with review and approval
 *   Episodes      what is live on the show, read from the public feed
 *   Distribution  what this hub sent to RSS.com and how it went, failures first
 *   Settings      the Plaud connection, the refresh timer's record, and links
 *                 to the settings this hub reads but does not own
 *
 * Providers are named in the header and inside the tabs, not as tabs.
 *
 * Deep links are `?tab=`, which this page did not have at all before — it held
 * the selected tab in `useState`, so no link could name one and Back could not
 * leave one. The two old provider ids and the Plaud sub-tab ids land where
 * their content went (recording-hub/tabs.js).
 *
 * The transcript list is read once, here, because Transcripts and Distribution
 * are two views of it: approving a transcript is exactly what creates the
 * RSS.com record Distribution shows (useRecordingHub). /admin/recordings
 * redirects here.
