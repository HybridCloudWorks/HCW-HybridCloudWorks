/**
 * Guards for two defects the education pages shipped with, both of which are
 * invisible to every other test in this repository because both are a matter
 * of which class or attribute a JSX element happens to carry.
 *
 * 1. Light mode. `src/index.css` sets `--background: 0 0% 100%` and
 *    `--card: 0 0% 100%`, and `ThemeContext` follows the OS by default, so a
 *    heading with a bare `text-white` is white on white for any visitor whose
 *    machine is in light mode. Five of the six certification hubs had fifteen
 *    of them each and zero `dark:text-white`; the Azure page, built later,
 *    had the `text-slate-950 dark:text-white` pairing throughout. The page
 *    still renders, still passes a render test, and is simply blank.
 *
 *    `text-white` on a coloured button is the correct thing and stays — the
 *    rule below is therefore "paired with `dark:` OR sitting on an opaque
 *    background", not "never".
 *
 * 2. The carousel pagination. The dots were `<button />` with no children and
 *    no label, which a screen reader announces as "button, button, button",
 *    and the prev/next buttons contained only the ligature text
 *    `chevron_left` / `chevron_right`, which is announced literally.
 *
 * A grep over the source is the right shape for both: the failure mode is a
 * class name or a missing attribute, so nothing short of reading the source
 * can see it, and the cost of regressing is one plausible-looking line.
