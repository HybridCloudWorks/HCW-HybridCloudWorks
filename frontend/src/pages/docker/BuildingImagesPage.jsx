/**
 * `/docker/building-images` (#772): the Docker hub's first focus area,
 * building container images, with the site's own lab image as the worked
 * example. Every statement about the image is read from the repository, not
 * remembered:
 *   lab-image/Dockerfile               — the stages, the FROM lines, USER, ENV,
 *                                        the mirror and the vendoring
 *   lab-image/versions.env             — BASE_IMAGE and BASE_DIGEST, every sum
 *   lab-image/smoke.sh                 — what the smoke test refuses and checks
 *   lab-image/README.md                — the measured mirror sizes, the local
 *                                        commands and what success prints
 *   .github/workflows/publish-lab-image.yml — the FROM check, the two jobs,
 *                                        `provenance: false`, the push and the
 *                                        attestation
 * Re-read them before changing a sentence here. A change to any of those files
 * that alters what this page says should change this page in the same PR.
 *
 * WHAT THE PAGE LEAVES OUT, ON PURPOSE. public-copy.test.js keeps the runner
 * image's registry name, digests written out, and the vendored modules' path
 * off every public page (owner request 2026-09-28), so the runner target is
 * described and not tagged, the commands build and run the `full` target, and
 * a digest is something a command prints rather than something the page
 * quotes. Nothing here needs an allowance in that test.
 *
 * Every command was written against those files on 2026-10-02 and is printed
 * for both shells. Git Bash rewrites an argument that looks like a Unix path
 * into a Windows one, so the bash lines that hand Docker a container path set
 * MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1, as the lab image README does; elsewhere that variable
 * does nothing.

          Everything below is in the site’s public repository: the Dockerfile and its pinned
          versions under <Code>lab-image/</Code>, and the workflow under{' '}
          <Code>.github/workflows/</Code>. Clone it and work from its root, because every command
          here names <Code>lab-image</Code> as a relative path. You need Docker with BuildKit, which
          is the default builder in Docker Desktop and in Docker Engine 23 and later; the Dockerfile
          uses <Code>RUN --mount</Code> and <Code>COPY --chmod</Code>, which need it.
        </p>

      <GuideSection id="targets" title="One Dockerfile, two targets">
        <p className={PROSE}>
          The file has five stages. Three of them, <Code>fetch</Code>, <Code>vendor</Code> and{' '}
          <Code>mirror</Code>, only build: they download, verify and prepare, and nothing from them
          ships except what a later stage copies out. The other two are the images people use:
        </p>
        <ul className={`${PROSE} list-disc space-y-2 pl-5`}>
          <li>
            <Code>runner</Code> carries terraform, kubeconform, helm and ansible-core, the Terraform
            provider mirror and the vendored modules. It starts from the base image again and copies
            in only what the build stages produced, so curl, unzip and git, which <Code>fetch</Code>{' '}
            installs to do its work, are not in it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <Code>full</Code> is <Code>FROM runner</Code> plus the Azure CLI, kubectl, git, curl and
            jq, and the packages VS Code in the browser needs. Its default command is{' '}
            <Code>bash</Code>. This is the image the labs run and the one you pull.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className={PROSE}>
          <Code>--target</Code> picks which stage the build stops at, and BuildKit builds only the
          stages that stage depends on. This builds <Code>full</Code> and tags it locally;{' '}
          <Code>--target runner</Code> builds the smaller image the same way. The image is
          linux/amd64 only, because every binary the Dockerfile downloads is the linux_amd64 build,
          so on a Mac with Apple silicon add <Code>--platform linux/amd64</Code>, as in the third
          line, and the build runs under emulation.
        </p>
        <Commands commands={COMMANDS.build} testId="commands-build" />
        <p className={PROSE}>
          Docker’s own guide to the pattern is{' '}
          <SourceLink href={SOURCE_LINKS.multiStageDocs}>Multi-stage builds</SourceLink>.
        </p>
      </GuideSection>

      <GuideSection id="digest" title="Base images pinned by digest">
        <p className={PROSE}>
          Both stages that start from an image, <Code>fetch</Code> and <Code>runner</Code>, start
          from the official <Code>python:3.14.7-slim-trixie</Code> (CPython 3.14.7 on Debian 13),
          written as the tag, an <Code>@</Code>, and the image’s index digest. A tag can be moved to
          a different image at any time; a digest is the hash of the content, so it cannot. As the
          Dockerfile’s own header puts it, the tag beside the digest is documentation: Docker
          resolves the digest and ignores the tag. The other three stages start from an earlier
          stage, which this lists alongside them:
        </p>
        <Commands commands={COMMANDS.fromLines} testId="commands-from" />
        <p className={PROSE}>
          A <Code>FROM</Code> line cannot read a file, so the digest is written twice: in the
          Dockerfile, and as <Code>BASE_IMAGE</Code> and <Code>BASE_DIGEST</Code> in{' '}
          <SourceLink href={SOURCE_LINKS.versions}>versions.env</SourceLink>. The publish workflow’s
          first step reads every <Code>FROM</Code> and fails the build unless each one is an earlier
          stage or exactly that image and digest, tag included. A bare tag, a different digest or a{' '}
          <Code>--platform</Code> flag on the line all fail it.
        </p>
        <p className={PROSE}>
          To see what the tag points at today, ask the registry. The <Code>Digest</Code> line it
          prints is the value in the <Code>FROM</Code> lines unless Docker has rebuilt the tag since
          the pin was last moved, and if the two differ, the pin is doing its job: the build keeps
          the image it was tested with until someone moves it on purpose.
        </p>
        <Commands commands={COMMANDS.inspectBase} testId="commands-inspect" />
      </GuideSection>

      <GuideSection id="checksums" title="Nothing downloaded without a checksum">
        <p className={PROSE}>
          Every version and checksum lives in versions.env, which each <Code>RUN</Code> sources
          before it starts. Each binary is checked with <Code>sha256sum -c</Code> straight after its
          download, and because the shell runs with <Code>set -eu</Code>, a sum that does not match
          fails the build rather than leaving an unverified binary in place. ansible-core and each
          package it depends on are fetched by pip in hash-checking mode with{' '}
          <Code>--only-binary=:all:</Code>, so nothing is built from source and nothing outside the
          list can be pulled in, and the <Code>runner</Code> stage installs them a second time from
          those same files with no package index at all. pip is then removed, so the image carries
          no pip command.
        </p>
      </GuideSection>

      <GuideSection id="offline" title="Vendored for offline use">
        <p className={PROSE}>
          The lab’s own checks run with no network, so <Code>terraform init</Code> has to work
          without one. Two things make that possible.
        </p>
        <ul className={`${PROSE} list-disc space-y-2 pl-5`}>
          <li>
            <strong>A provider mirror.</strong> The <Code>mirror</Code> stage runs{' '}
            <Code>terraform providers mirror</Code> for azurerm (at a 5.x and a 4.x version), azapi,
            alz, random, modtm and time, checks each provider’s zip against its pinned sum, and then
            unpacks it. Unpacked matters: from a packed mirror <Code>terraform init</Code> copies
            each provider into <Code>.terraform</Code> (225 MB for azurerm), while from an unpacked
            one it links to the mirror and copies nothing, which leaves a 40 KB{' '}
            <Code>.terraform</Code> in the repository’s own measurement. A CLI config file then
            makes the mirror the only source, with no fallback to the registry, so an unmirrored
            provider fails at once instead of hanging on a registry it cannot reach.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Azure Verified Modules.</strong> Terraform has a provider mirror but no
            module mirror. So the image carries every Azure Verified Module the Landing Zone Builder
            emits, from each module’s release tarball and checked by SHA256, and every registry
            module those call. A script rewrites each call inside the copies from its registry
            source to a relative path, and a second <Code>terraform get</Code> proves nothing left
            in the tree reaches the registry.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className={PROSE}>
          The mirror is an ordinary directory, so you can look at it. This prints the two provider
          namespaces it holds, <Code>azure</Code> and <Code>hashicorp</Code>:
        </p>
        <Commands commands={COMMANDS.mirror} testId="commands-mirror" />
        <p className={PROSE}>
          Inside the container, <Code>TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE=/dev/null terraform init</Code> sets the
          config aside for one command and uses the registry instead, which needs the network.
        </p>
      </GuideSection>

      <GuideSection id="non-root" title="Running as a non-root user">
        <p className={PROSE}>
          Both images end with <Code>USER 65534:65534</Code>, Debian’s <Code>nobody</Code>, and{' '}
          <Code>WORKDIR /workspace</Code>. The lab mounts <Code>/workspace</Code> read-only, so
          everything the tools write goes under <Code>/tmp</Code>: <Code>HOME</Code> is{' '}
          <Code>/tmp/home</Code>, and <Code>TMPDIR</Code>, Terraform’s data directory, and Helm’s
          and Ansible’s working files are all under <Code>/tmp/run</Code>. In the{' '}
          <Code>runner</Code> image <Code>nobody</Code> keeps its no-login shell. The{' '}
          <Code>full</Code> image switches back to root only to install its packages and to give{' '}
          <Code>nobody</Code> a bash shell and that home, because the browser workspaces run their
          terminal through the user’s own shell, and then drops back to 65534.

      </GuideSection>

      <GuideSection id="smoke" title="Smoke tests">
        <p className={PROSE}>
          A build that succeeds proves the files arrived, not that the tools work.{' '}
          <SourceLink href={SOURCE_LINKS.smoke}>smoke.sh</SourceLink> runs inside the image with{' '}
          <Code>lab-image</Code> mounted read-only and the network off, and it first refuses to pass
          if the network is reachable or the mount is writable, because an offline{' '}
          <Code>terraform init</Code> that had a network would prove nothing. Then it compares each
          tool’s version with versions.env, checks every mirrored provider and vendored module is on
          disk, and runs <Code>terraform init -backend=false</Code> and{' '}
          <Code>terraform validate</Code> against small configurations with no network. For{' '}
          <Code>full</Code> it also checks the extra tools and the user’s shell. From the repository

          A passing run ends with <Code>smoke: passed (full)</Code> and exits 0. A failing check
          prints <Code>FAIL:</Code> with the tool’s output under it, and the script runs every
          remaining check before it exits 1, so one run shows everything that is wrong. The bash
          line asks Git Bash for a Windows-style path with <Code>pwd -W</Code> and falls back to{' '}

          A provenance attestation is a signed record of where an image came from: which repository,

          <SourceLink href={SOURCE_LINKS.attestAction}>actions/attest-build-provenance</SourceLink>,
          given the image’s name and digest and <Code>push-to-registry: true</Code>, so the
