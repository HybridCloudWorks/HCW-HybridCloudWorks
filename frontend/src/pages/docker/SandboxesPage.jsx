/**
 * `/docker/sandboxes` (#774): the Docker hub's third focus area, running a
 * coding agent in a Docker sandbox. The recipe itself is `SandboxSection`,
 * moved here unchanged from `/education/labs` (#676), where the section's
 * old anchor now holds a one-line pointer to this page so old links still
 * land somewhere that says where the recipe went.
 *
 * LIVE-CHECK. The `sbx` command line changes often (#774 keeps the label), so
 * the page says when its commands were last read against Docker's
 * documentation. On 2026-09-29 these still held, read from:
 *   https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/                  — microVM isolation; the sbx CLI
 *                                                            and local sandboxes are free,
 *                                                            including for commercial work
 *   https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/sbx/run/         — `sbx run [flags] [AGENT] [PATH...]`
 *                                                            creates the sandbox when it does
 *                                                            not exist; `--name` reattaches;
 *                                                            `-t/--template` is the image
 *   https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/agents/claude-code/ — `sbx secret set anthropic`
 *   https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/cloud/            — `--cloud`, a Docker Agentic
 *                                                            Platform subscription, no host
 *                                                            workspace, one-hour default expiry
 * Re-read them, and move CHECKED_ON, before changing a word of the commands.
 *
 * A static route like `/docker/tools`, declared in App.jsx and listed in
 * STANDALONE_ROUTES in scripts/prerender-entry.jsx, so it pre-renders. Nothing
 * here reads the API: the section is editorial, and a sandbox runs on the
 * visitor's machine.

            give it an isolated microVM on your own machine, and the sbx command line and local
            sandboxes are free to use, including for commercial work. This is the recipe for
            pointing one at a landing zone you build on this site.
