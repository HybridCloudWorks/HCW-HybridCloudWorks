/**
 * One lab's page: its objectives, steps and resources, and its workspace in
 * a pane on the site (#751; the structure since ADR 0033 §4). Two addresses,
 * one page:
 *
 *   /:provider/education/labs/:labId   under the provider's Learn section,
 *                                      the canonical one (the lab's first
 *                                      provider when it is listed under two)
 *   /education/labs/:labId             from the cross-provider index, kept
 *                                      for links written before ADR 0033
 *
 * The provider comes from the route; "Back to labs" returns to the list the
 * visitor came from. The page body is the catalogue row (LabSteps, LabFacts,
 * LabArticles) around the pane, plus "How labs work" (HowLabsWork) and the
 * one-word workspace state (WorkspaceStatusBadge) from the same status read
 * that decides whether the pane opens. Stop and reset are the workspace's
 * own: the page says where they are and does not pretend to hold them.
 *
 * WHY A PANE. Owner decision 2026-09-28: the lab is reached only through
 * panes on the site (ADR 0032, amendment of that date). #750 enforces it on
 * the lab host: every name under lab.hybridcloudworks.com, Coder's included,
 * answers a top-level visit with a 302 to `/education/labs`, and only the
 * site may frame it. So the one way into a workspace is a frame on a site
 * page, and this is that page. The site's `frame-src` admits Coder's origin
 * and its workspace apps' wildcard and nothing else new (csp.test.js).
 *
 * WHAT THE PANE LOADS. The lab launcher on Coder's name (`labLauncherUrl`):
 * `https://coder.lab.hybridcloudworks.com/_hcw/lab/?lab=<id>`
 * (lab-host/coder/launcher/). Coder's dashboard opens code-server in a new
 * window or tab, which #750 turns into the labs page, so from the dashboard
 * the editor never opened in the pane. The launcher reads the learner's
 * workspace with their session, shows Coder's own create or start page in a
 * frame of its own when the learner has to confirm something, and when
 * code-server is healthy replaces itself with code-server's own name. Both
 * are Coder's names, so `frame-src`, the sandbox and `allow` below are
 * unchanged by it.
 *
 * WHAT THE PANE SAYS. The launcher posts its state to this page
 * (`{ type: 'hcw-lab', state }`), the one thing a cross-origin frame can
 * tell it. The page takes a message only from the launcher's origin, only
 * from this pane's own window, and only with a type and a state it knows
 * (`paneMessageState`). A message means the frame loaded, so it stops the
 * load watchdog; the state is shown on the toolbar; and `unavailable` shows
 * the page's own unavailable section.
 *
 * SIGN-IN RUNS IN A TAB OF ITS OWN, because GitHub refuses to be framed and
 * the site's `frame-src` does not admit it either. Worked out from Coder
 * v2.37.3's source and #750's exemption, step by step:
 *
 *   1. "Sign in with GitHub" is a link that opens a new tab at
 *      `coder.lab…/api/v2/users/oauth2/github/callback?redirect=%2F`
 *      (`coderSignInUrl`), and its click records which lab it came from
 *      (labSignIn.js). Not Coder's `/login` in the tab: #750 redirects a
 *      top-level `/login` to `/education/labs` before Coder sees it. The
 *      callback path is the one path #750 lets through at the top level, on
 *      Coder's own name only (10-coder.caddy.j2), and Coder serves the START
 *      of sign-in from it too: a request with no `code` gets Coder's
 *      `oauth_state` and `oauth_redirect` cookies and a 307 to GitHub's
 *      authorize page (coderd/httpmw/oauth2.go, ExtractOAuth2). That is the
 *      URL Coder's own GitHub button links to (OAuthSignInForm.tsx).
 *   2. GitHub signs the visitor in, at the top level in that tab, and sends
 *      the tab back to the callback with `code` and `state`. The exemption
 *      lets it through. The state cookie is SameSite=Lax (Coder allows only
 *      lax or none), which a top-level GET from GitHub carries. Coder checks
 *      the organisation, sets its session cookie on its own name, and
 *      answers 307 to `redirect`, a path on Coder (SafeRedirectPath).
 *   3. That is a top-level visit to a Coder path that is not the callback,
 *      so #750 answers it with a 302 to `/education/labs`. Every sign-in
 *      ends there, whatever `redirect` said.
 *   4. `/education/labs` (useLabSignInReturn) sees a fresh record on a page
 *      entered from outside the site, removes it, records the sign-in, and
 *      replaces its URL with this lab's page. The tab is now this page, and
 *      its pane opens signed in.
 *   5. Recording the sign-in fires a `storage` event in the first tab, where
 *      this page is still open. It leaves the sign-in step and reloads the
 *      pane with a new frame, which now carries the session.
 *
 * The session reaches the pane because coder.lab.hybridcloudworks.com and
 * hybridcloudworks.com are one site (the registrable domain), so the frame's
 * requests are same-site and send Coder's Lax cookie; no third-party cookie
 * is involved. Sign-in cannot happen inside the pane: GitHub will not load
 * in a frame. The launcher, finding no session, says to use Sign in with
 * GitHub above, and tells this page, which marks that button on the toolbar.
 *
 * What this page cannot know before the pane opens: whether the visitor is
 * signed in, since the pane is another origin. It shows the sign-in step
 * until this browser has come back from a sign-in (for Coder's default
 * 24-hour session), with "I've already signed in" for a visitor who has, and
 * keeps Sign in with GitHub on the toolbar for a session that has expired;
 * once the pane is open, the launcher's `signed-out` says so. A visitor
 * GitHub signs in but Coder refuses (outside the organisation) is sent to
 * Coder's `/login`, which #750 also turns into `/education/labs`, so the
 * return looks the same and the launcher reports no session again; the step
 * says who may sign in.
 *
 * UNAVAILABLE. Before the pane opens, the page asks the status read the labs
 * page's card shows (`GET public/labs/coder-status`, at most a minute old).
 * The pane opens only when that read says configured and reachable, which
 * needs Coder's address and Coder answering and nothing else (not the status
 * token, since 2026-09-28). Anything else (not configured, unreachable, the
 * route missing, the read failing), a frame that has not loaded within
 * PANE_LOAD_TIMEOUT_MS (a frame fires no `error` event, so the wait is the
 * only failure it can signal without the launcher), and the launcher
 * reporting `unavailable` all show one sentence, never the error. The lab
 * host's own answer for a stopped Coder is the same sentence.
 *
 * PRE-RENDER. One page per catalogue row, like the Azure certification
 * pages (scripts/prerender-entry.jsx). The first render reads no storage and
 * no clock: the status read starts in an effect, and the sign-in record is
 * read through `useSyncExternalStore`, whose server snapshot is "not signed
 * in". So the built HTML is the lab's heading and the opening sentence, and
 * hydration matches it.
