/**
 * Each architecture page renders the blueprints its sibling data module exports
 * (issue #373).
 *
 * WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS. The pre-render decides whether to advertise
 * `/<provider>/architecture-designs` by importing
 * `src/pages/<provider>/architecture-blueprints.js` and counting it
 * (`staticSectionItems` in scripts/prerender.mjs). That count is only worth
 * acting on while the page renders the same array — a page that stopped
 * importing its module would keep its sitemap entry and show nothing, which is
 * the bug this whole mechanism exists to fix, restored by a refactor.
 *
 * The API is given nothing on purpose. What is left on the page is then exactly
 * the module's contribution, which is the half `manifest.sections` cannot see.
