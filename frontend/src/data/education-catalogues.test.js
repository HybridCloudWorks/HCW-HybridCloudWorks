/**
 * Every Learn catalogue this repository hand-maintains is checked here against
 * the calendar (#461, owner rule: "Old info is a no-no for Learn sites").
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The 2026-09-09 audit found the Azure page showing ten
 * exams as "expiring" ten weeks after Microsoft retired them, AWS listing
 * SOA-C02 under the CloudOps name a year after SOA-C03 replaced it, GitHub
 * with three exam codes on the wrong titles, Terraform advertising an exam
 * HashiCorp retired in July, and GCP missing five of Google's fourteen
 * certifications. None of it failed anything: a hand-typed `status` is a
 * claim with no date attached, and nothing ever compared it to today.
 *
 * Now the pages derive what they render from the dates (`@/lib/certStatus`),
 * so a card cannot say "expiring" after the last test day. What this test
 * adds is the alarm: the moment an `expiring`, `beta` or `upcoming` row's date
 * is in the past, the suite goes red until someone re-verifies the row
 * against the vendor and updates it.
 *
 * It no longer arrives unannounced. `frontend/scripts/catalogue-due-soon.mjs`
 * asks `findStatusesDueWithin` which rows this test will name in the next 21
 * days, and the Monday `warn-catalogue-due.yml` run keeps one issue on the
 * board listing them, so each re-verification is scheduled weeks before the
 * build goes red rather than discovered by it (#818). The rows due next are in
 * that issue, not here: a list in this comment went stale the day MLA-C01
 * fired.
 *
 * Deliberately uses the real clock. A frozen date would make the assertion
 * vacuous — the point is that the repository notices when the world moves.
 *
 * Azure's catalogue has the same check in `azure/certifications.test.js`
 * (#464); both run through the one `findStaleStatuses` in `@/lib/certStatus`.
 *
 * Azure joined `CATALOGUES` here with #496, which is what made the DATA_SOURCE
 * assertion below cover all eight. Until then it was the one catalogue outside
 * this list, so it was the one catalogue that could omit `DATA_SOURCE` without
 * failing a build — and it did, from #461 until #496. Its own test file stayed:
 * it carries the Azure-only rows (applied skills, retirement replacements) that
 * do not generalise, and duplicating the shared assertions costs nothing.

/**
 * #494: the rows whose dates pass at the end of September 2026.
 *
 * The alarm above is deliberately tied to the real clock, so it says nothing
 * about a date until that date arrives — which leaves the interesting question
 * unanswerable on any day before it: when 2026-09-30 passes, does the site tell
 * a reader something false, or does it merely stop being able to prove itself?
 *
 * These pin the answer at a fixed future day, so it is known now rather than
 * discovered by a red build. Two facts, and they point opposite ways:
 *
 *   THE PAGES DO NOT LIE. `deriveStatus` reads the dates at render time, so on
 *   2026-10-01 AZ-800 and AZ-801 render `retired` and PAA renders `upcoming`
 *   without anyone touching a file. Whatever the stored `status` says, no
 *   visitor is shown a retired exam as testable or a closed beta as open.
 *
 *   THE CLAIMS GO UNPROVABLE ANYWAY, which is what the alarm is for. A stored
 *   `status` that its own dates have overtaken is a claim nobody has rechecked
 *   against the vendor, and the vendor is the only thing that can say what the
 *   credential became. So the suite goes red and names the rows.
 *
 * #494's own table listed three rows and missed one: AZ-800 carries the same
 * `expiryDate` 2026-09-30 and the same `replacedBy: 'az-802'` as AZ-801, so it
 * trips in the same breath. The count was the check on that — four rows
 * across three catalogues, not the one the issue expected a person to fix.
 *
 * 2026-10-01 (#770): the day came and each vendor was re-read. Microsoft
 * retired AZ-800 and AZ-801 as announced; Google's PAA page still published no
 * GA date, so PAA is stored `upcoming` with no date. The stored statuses now
 * agree with what `deriveStatus` showed on the day, so the list of overtaken
 * rows is empty, and these tests now pin that the re-verified rows say what
 * the vendors said rather than what their old dates implied.
