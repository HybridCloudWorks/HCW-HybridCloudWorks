/**
 * The lab catalogue (#681, Coder Phase 3 of #659; per-provider structure in
 * ADR 0033 §4 "Labs").
 *
 * PURE DATA. Nothing here fetches, formats or renders; the pages derive every
 * card, step and link from these rows and `catalogue.test.js` asserts each
 * row carries every field below with the right shape, that no two share an
 * `id`, and that every provider, difficulty, tool and validation job type
 * comes from the fixed lists this file exports.
 *
 * ADDING A LAB IS ADDING A ROW — AND ONE TEMPLATE ENTRY. A new lab family
 * (an AWS lab, a Kubernetes lab under Azure, a second Ansible lab) needs:
 *
 *   1. one row here, with `providers` naming the provider hub(s) it is
 *      listed under (`/<provider>/education/labs`, every provider already
 *      has that route) and `technology` naming what it exercises;
 *   2. one entry in the Coder template's lab map and parameter options
 *      (lab-host/coder/templates/hcw-lab/main.tf) and one in the launcher's
 *      LAB_WORKSPACES (lab-host/coder/launcher/launcher.js), both keyed by
 *      the same `id`.
 *
 * No new route, page or component: the provider list filters by
 * `providers`, the cross-provider index groups by it, the pane page renders
 * the row's steps, and the admin Catalogue tab lists it. A provider that is
 * not yet in VALID_PROVIDERS (context/ProviderContext.jsx) is the one thing
 * this cannot do, because the `/:provider` routes do not exist for it.
 *
 * `id` doubles as the Coder template parameter: the lab's pane
 * (`/<provider>/education/labs/<id>`, or `/education/labs/<id>` from the
 * index, #751) loads the lab launcher with `?lab=<id>` (`labLauncherUrl`),
 * which creates the learner's workspace from the `hcw-lab` template (#679)
 * with `param.lab=<id>`, and the template opens that lab's folder in
 * code-server. So an `id` is a path segment and a Terraform variable value at
 * once — lowercase, hyphenated, no spaces — which the test also enforces.
 *
 * `workspaceName` is the name the launcher gives the learner's workspace for
 * this lab, one per lab per learner. The launcher keeps the same map
 * (LAB_WORKSPACES in lab-host/coder/launcher/launcher.js) because it may only
 * act on names it holds itself; this test and
 * scripts/lab-host-launcher.test.mjs both fail when the two differ. At most
 * 16 characters: code-server's address is `code-server--<workspace>--<owner>`,
 * one DNS label of 63, and a Coder username can be 32.
 *
 * `tools` names what the lab actually exercises, from the toolchain the
 * `hcw-lab` image ships (ADR 0032 §5). `status` is `available` for every lab
 * the public pages list; a `coming` lab is kept out of them and must carry
 * `comingSince` (a date) and `comingReason`, so nothing is promised without
 * saying since when and why.
 *
 * EVERY STRING HERE IS VISITOR COPY. The rows render on public pages, so
 * they name what a learner sees (the workspace, the lab host, the runner's
 * checks) and never the tools behind the site; public-copy.test.js scans
 * this directory and LabPanePage.test.jsx holds the pane page to the same
 * rule.
