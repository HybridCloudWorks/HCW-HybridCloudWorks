/**
 * FinOps Foundation certification catalogue for /finops/education (#461,
 * item 11).
 *
 * Extracted from src/pages/finops/EducationPage.jsx, which carried the four
 * rows hard-coded with no record of when anyone had checked them. Verified
 * 2026-09-09 against learn.finops.org, where finops.org/certification/ now
 * redirects (301):
 *
 *   FinOps Certified Practitioner — listed, active, "Valid for 24 months",
 *     no formal prerequisites, self-paced course + exam $500, exam only $325
 *     (50 questions, 1 hour, 75% to pass).
 *     https://learn.finops.org/path/finops-certified-practitioner-self-paced
 *     https://learn.finops.org/finops-certified-practitioner-certification-exam
 *   FinOps Certified Professional — listed, active, Advanced, $500, "Valid
 *     for 24 Months"; enrolment requires a Practitioner or Engineer
 *     certification and six months of FinOps experience, and the exam
 *     requires the AI Value and Technology Value certifications plus a
 *     Professional Contribution.
 *     https://learn.finops.org/path/finops-certified-professional
 *   FinOps Certified Engineer — listed, active, Intermediate, "Self-paced +
 *     Exam Bundle: 10 hours; Exam only: 1 hour", exam only $325. This file
 *     used to call it "FinOps Engineer".
 *     https://learn.finops.org/page/finops-certified-engineer
 *   "FinOps for Platform Engineers" — no such certification is listed. The
 *     nearest thing, the "FinOps for Engineers" training course (a course,
 *     never a certification), reads "Not currently available" on
 *     https://learn.finops.org/path/finops-for-engineers and is absent from
 *     the catalogue. Kept as `retired` with that evidence rather than
 *     deleted; the Foundation publishes no retirement date for it. Its
 *     replacement on this page is the Engineer certification.
 *
 * The Foundation publishes no exam codes. `FOCP` is its own abbreviation
 * for the Practitioner credential (its badge assets are named `focpicon`);
 * the other `code` values are this site's labels, kept for the card layout
 * and the learning-path keys, not vendor identifiers.
 *
 * Re-verified 2026-09-09 (#469 item 2) against the Foundation's own catalogue
 * at https://learn.finops.org/, which lists SIX certifications. The three the
 * first pass left out are now carried, each with the Foundation's own price,
 * exam level and validity from the page cited on the row:
 *
 *   FinOps Certified FOCUS Analyst — $400, "Exam Level: Intermediate",
 *     self-paced with 12 months of access to course materials, "Duration
 *     6 hours (approximately)", "Your certification is valid for 24 months".
 *     For anyone who generates, ingests, interprets or analyses billing and
 *     usage datasets aligned to the FOCUS specification.
 *     https://learn.finops.org/finops-certified-focus-analyst-certification
 *   FinOps Certified: AI Value — $500, five modules (Introduction, Levels
 *     1-3 and the certification exam) tagged Beginner through Advanced,
 *     valid for 24 months. Designed for FinOps Practitioners, or anyone
 *     applying the Framework to AI spend.
 *     https://learn.finops.org/path/certified-finops-for-ai
 *   FinOps Certified: Technology Value — $500, "Exam Level: Intermediate",
 *     six modules (FinOps Scopes, Public Cloud, SaaS, Data Center, Data
 *     Cloud Platform and the exam), valid for 24 months. For Practitioners
 *     extending a practice beyond public cloud.
 *     https://learn.finops.org/path/technology-value
 *
 * The Foundation lists AI Value and Technology Value as requirements of the
 * Professional exam, which is why the Professional row already named them
 * before they were carried here.
 *
 * `level` IS THIS SITE'S VOCABULARY, not the Foundation's. The page filters
 * and colours on three values — Practitioner, Professional, Expert — and the
 * Foundation grades exams Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced, which do not line
 * up: it rates the *Practitioner* exam Intermediate. So the Foundation's own
 * grade is stated in each row's description and `level` carries the role, as
 * it already did for Engineer. All three new rows are `Professional`.
 *
 * The Engineer page states no validity of its own; its recertification exam
 * does — "The renewed certification is valid for 24 months from the date the
 * recertification exam is passed" — which is where that row's 24 months comes
 * from (https://learn.finops.org/finops-certified-engineer-recertification-exam,
 * read 2026-09-09). Every other row's page states it directly.
 *
 * `hours` is only set where the Foundation publishes a duration. It does so
 * for FOCUS Analyst (6) and not for AI Value or Technology Value, which it
 * sizes in modules; the card omits the badge rather than carrying a guess.
 *
 * `status` and any dates are read through `@/lib/certStatus` at render time;
 * `src/data/education-catalogues.test.js` fails when a dated row is past.
