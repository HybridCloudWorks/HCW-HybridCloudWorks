/**
 * `PROVIDER_FEEDS` as functions/src/lib/rss/feeds.js declares it: the feeds
 * the server actually reads. For tests only; it needs Node's `fs` and `vm`,
 * and nothing the browser loads imports it.
 *
 * The server module cannot be imported from here: it imports an HTML parser
 * that only `functions/` installs, and CI's frontend job installs nothing
 * else. So the object literal is cut out of the file and evaluated on its
 * own. It is plain data (strings, arrays, objects and comments), which is
 * what makes that safe, and a file the cut cannot find throws rather than
 * reading as an empty list. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the frontend job
 * when that file changes.
