/**
 * vmware education data.
 *
 * Extracted from src/pages/vmware/EducationPage.jsx when that page moved onto the
 * shared EducationTemplate.
 *
 * Certification catalogue verified 2026-09-09 (#461) against Broadcom's VMware
 * certification pages and exam guides:
 *   VCP-VVF Administrator 2V0-16.25, VCP-VCF Administrator 2V0-17.25 and
 *   VCP-VCF Architect 2V0-13.25 (Broadcom certification pages);
 *   VCAP-VCF Administrator 3V0-11.26, Architect 3V0-12.26 and Support
 *   3V0-13.26 — the role-based VCAPs whose exam guides Broadcom dated
 *   August 18, 2026 — replace the VCAP-DCV Deploy entry this file used to
 *   carry, which no longer appears on Broadcom's certification path.
 *   VCTA-DCV is the Data Center Virtualization track named in Broadcom's
 *   VCTA FAQ; Broadcom publishes no per-track VCTA page today.
 *
 * Re-verified 2026-09-10 (#469 item 1) against Broadcom's certification index,
 * https://www.broadcom.com/support/education/vmware/certification, which today
 * groups its career certifications as thirteen under VMware Cloud Foundation,
 * one VCDX, two under Application Networking & Security, and two under
 * "VMware Legacy Certifications" (VCP-DCV 2V0-21.23, VCP-NV 2V0-41.24). Every
 * exam code this file carries still appears there, on the title it carries:
 *   VCP-VVF Administrator 2V0-16.25, VCP-VCF Administrator 2V0-17.25,
 *   VCP-VCF Architect 2V0-13.25, VCAP-VCF Administrator 3V0-11.26,
 *   VCAP-VCF Architect 3V0-12.26 and VCAP-VCF Support 3V0-13.26.
 * The three VCAP rows now link to their own Broadcom pages rather than the
 * index — /vcap-vcf-administrator9, /vcap-vcf-architect9 and
 * /vcap-vcf-support9, the URLs the index itself links them by. VCP-VVF's
 * title gained the "VMware" that Broadcom puts in front of the product name.
 *
 * VCTA IS GONE, and that is the one substantive change. Broadcom's index
 * lists no VMware Certified Technical Associate certification at any level —
 * not under VCF, not under Legacy — and VCTA-DCV 2024 (1V0-21.20) appears in
 * https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/vmware-retired-exams-certifications-and-badges
 * under "Inactive or Retired Exams ... no longer attainable for new
 * candidates". The row is therefore `retired` and points at that document.
 * No `retiredDate`: Broadcom publishes the retirement in a list without a date
 * against this entry, and a guessed date here would be worse than none.
 * No `replacement` either — Broadcom names no associate-level successor, and
 * VCP-VVF is a Professional credential rather than a like-for-like swap.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP, deliberately left for #469 rather than guessed at: Broadcom's
 * thirteen VCF certifications include seven this file does not carry — VCP-VCF
 * Support (2V0-15.25), VCP-VVF Support (2V0-18.25) and the five subject VCAPs,
 * Automation (3V0-21.25), Operations (3V0-22.25), Storage (3V0-23.25), VKS
 * (3V0-24.25) and Networking (3V0-25.25) — plus VCDX and the two ANS VCPs.
 * Their titles and exam codes are on the index above, but `hours` and
 * `prepTime` are this site's own study estimates and inventing fourteen of
 * them is exactly the confidently-wrong entry this catalogue exists to avoid.
 *
 * `status` and any dates are read through `@/lib/certStatus` at render time;
 * `src/data/education-catalogues.test.js` fails when a dated row is past.
 *
 * DATA_AS_OF is 2026-09-10 and not 2026-09-11 on purpose: the checks above ran
 * at 2026-09-11T04:10Z, which is still 2026-09-10 on the local calendar that
 * `todayIso()` — and therefore the "is DATA_AS_OF in the future" assertion —
 * reads. The earlier of the two days is the one that is true for every viewer.
