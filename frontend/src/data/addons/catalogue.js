/**
 * The AddOn catalogue (ADR 0035; the HCW AddOn Integration Standard,
 * docs/standards/addon-integration-standard.md, section 4).
 *
 * PURE DATA. An AddOn is an independently built tool the site shows in a
 * sandboxed pane at `/tools/<id>`: its own origin on a lab name, its own
 * release cadence, its own secrets on the lab host. The site holds one row
 * here per AddOn and derives everything else from it: the page
 * (pages/tools/AddOnPanePage.jsx), the Tools menu (components/shared/Header.jsx),
 * the pre-render list (scripts/prerender-entry.jsx), the `frame-src` entry
 * the CSP needs (csp.test.js reads `addonOrigins()`) and the parity check
 * against the Function App's closed registry
 * (functions/src/lib/addons/registry.js). `catalogue.test.js` holds every
 * row to the shape below.
 *
 * ADDING AN ADDON IS ADDING A ROW, a server registry entry, one app setting
 * (`ADDON_<ID>_URL` in infra/functionapp.tf), one `addons[]` entry in
 * lab-host/ansible/group_vars/all.yml and one `frame-src` source in
 * frontend/staticwebapp.config.json. Routes stay hand-declared in App.jsx,
 * one lazy page per row, because routes-are-complete.test.js expects every
 * absolute route to be declared and pre-rendered one by one.
 *
 * `id` is the path segment, the hostname label (`<id>.lab.hybridcloudworks.com`)
 * and the setting suffix at once: lowercase, hyphenated, no spaces, which the
 * test enforces. `status` is `available` for a row the site frames; a
 * `coming` row renders an explainer and no frame, is kept out of the menu,
 * the CSP and the server registry's reachable set, and must carry
 * `comingSince` and `comingReason`, so nothing is promised without saying
 * since when and why.
 *
 * `capabilities` is what the PAGE GRANTS THE PANE (sandbox and `allow`
 * flags), not what the AddOn can do; the running image reports its own
 * `capabilities` in `/api/health` and the status proxy passes those through
 * for the admin card. The two lists differ on purpose.
 *
 * EVERY COPY FIELD IS VISITOR COPY. `title`, `menuLabel`, `summary`,
 * `comingReason` and `articleSlugs[].title` render on public pages and name
 * nothing behind the site; public-copy.test.js scans this directory.
 * `origin`, `panePath`, `healthPath` and `docsUrl` are addresses, not copy,
 * and legitimately contain `api`.
 */
/**
