/**
 * Everything the Recording Hub reads and writes, in one place (#576).
 *
 * The hub is organised by duty now, and two of those duties are two views of
 * one list: approving a transcript on **Transcripts** is what queues its
 * publish to RSS.com, which is the only thing **Distribution** has to show. A
 * per-tab read would let them disagree about the same transcript, so this
 * lives at page level the way CertificationsPage owns useCertifications and
 * ListenAndLearnPage owns useListenAndLearn.
 *
 * The other reads are here for the same reason rather than by habit:
 *
 *  - the Plaud connection decides whether **Recordings** can list the live
 *    library at all, and **Settings** is where it is connected — so connecting
 *    on one must light up the other;
 *  - the podcast feed read answers both **Episodes** (the show) and
 *    **Distribution** (the feed URL), from one call.
 *
 * Race-safe the way #555 hardened the Newsletter Hub:
 *
 *  - every transcript read carries a generation, so a reload that resolves
 *    after a newer one paints nothing rather than restoring rows a review has
 *    already changed;
 *  - unmounting (or auth going away) supersedes whatever is in flight;
 *  - a FAILED read leaves the error and does not silently keep stale rows
 *    beside it;
 *  - writes are guarded per transcript: a second approve or retry on one whose
 *    first write has not answered is ignored, not sent twice.
 *
 * The hook only holds state. The reads and writes below are module-level
 * functions over one state bag, each with a single exit — the shape
 * useCertifications documents, and the reason this stays inside Qlty's
 * complexity and return-count budgets as it grows.
