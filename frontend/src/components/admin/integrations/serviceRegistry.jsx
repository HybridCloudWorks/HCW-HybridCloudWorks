/**
 * The Integrations Hub's registry: every service, the group it sits under, and
 * the browser-side test that asks it whether it works.
 *
 * Moved unchanged out of pages/admin/IntegrationsPage.jsx (#570), which is now
 * only the tab bar. Every tab reads this one list, so the Overview grid, the
 * Services cards and the Keys tab's "used by" line cannot disagree about which
 * service owns which key. The Health page's probe registry reads it too
 * (pages/admin/health/probeRegistry.js), so a service tested here is a service
 * probed there, by the same function.
 *
 * ADR 0033 (Platform) added a card for every AI key that until then appeared
 * only as a loose key on the Keys tab — Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI, NVIDIA,
 * Perplexity, ElevenLabs, Azure Speech, Firecrawl, Replicate — and one for the
 * Hybrid Lab's three values, each saying what the service is for, what it can
 * do, which hubs use it, which way data flows and what the key can reach.

 *
 * THREE FIELDS DRIVE THE CARD, and each may be absent for a reason:
 *
 *   `url`   Where this service lives, as specifically as possible: the page
 *           that holds the credential when there is one, and the owner’s own
 *           profile when there is not. EVERY service has one, and a test says
 *           so — a card with no key, no test and no link is a dead end.
 *   `test`  A GET that proves the credential works, or `null` where no cheap
 *           read exists. `null` is honest rather than lazy, and since ADR 0033
 *           it comes with `untestedReason` saying why, shown on the card: the
 *           education profiles are public HTML a browser cannot fetch from
 *           another origin; Perplexity has no read-only endpoint, so a test
 *           would be a paid completion; Azure Speech is unprovisioned on
 *           purpose.
 *
 *           NO BEAKER MEANS THE GLOBE HAS TO WORK HARDER. When a service holds
 *           credentials and offers no test, the only thing this page can do
 *           about a red light is send you where the credential is managed — so
 *           `url` must be that page, not the vendor’s front door. A test below
 *           holds it: such a service must point at a specific page rather
 *           than a bare host.
 *   `group` Which heading it sits under.
 *
 * FOUR MORE SAY WHAT THE SERVICE IS (ADR 0033 Platform), for a reader who has
 * never seen this repository: `capabilities` (what it can do here), `usedIn`
 * (which hubs call it), `dataDirection` (which way data flows) and
 * `securityNote` (what the key can reach and where it lives).
 *
 * Two optional fields put something the card can DO beneath the key lines,
 * and IntegrationsServices maps each to a component: `setting` for the one
 * service configured rather than credentialed (Sessionize’s speaker id), and
 * `action` for the one the site fills itself (the pricing cache’s Refresh
 * now). `reconnectHref` names the page holding a service's own sign-in flow
 * (Plaud's OAuth connect, in the Recording Hub). `keyGroups` splits a card's
 * keys into titled boxes, each of which may name a `panel` drawn inside it:
 * the Hybrid Lab card's Coder box carries the lab host's automatic renewal
 * (CoderAutomation). All are names, not components, so this file stays free
 * of React state and the registry test can read them as data.
 *
 * DESCRIPTIONS ARE FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER SEEN THIS REPOSITORY. One line,
 * saying what the service is and what it does for the site. No issue numbers,
 * no function names, no file paths.
