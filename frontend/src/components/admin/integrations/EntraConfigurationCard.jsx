/**
 * The Entra configuration this site runs on (#519).
 *
 * Shown on the Integrations Hub's Identity tab (#570); it used to sit under the
 * "Site platform" group — these are values the site runs on, and each one says
 * what changing it breaks. They are not Key Vault secrets, so they never appear in
 * `secret-catalog.js` and had no surface anywhere in the admin UI: a scope that
 * disagrees with the audience, or a SPA pointed at a different tenant from the
 * API, was invisible until every call started returning 401.
 *
 * WHAT IS SHOWN, AND WHY IT IS SAFE. Identifiers only — a tenant id, an
 * application id, an App Role name, a scope name. Every one of them is already
 * in the SPA's own bundle or in this repository, and the page's rule about
 * never rendering a credential is untouched: there is no credential here.
 *
 * BOTH HALVES, SIDE BY SIDE, WHICH IS THE POINT. The left column is what this
 * browser was built with; the right is what the API says it enforces, fetched
 * from `getAuthExpectations`. A page that compared the frontend against itself
 * would prove only that it agrees with itself.
 *
 * @param {{expectations: object|null, error: string|null}} props
