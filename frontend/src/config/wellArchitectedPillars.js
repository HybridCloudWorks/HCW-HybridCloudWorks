/**
 * Official Well-Architected pillar sets, per cloud provider.
 *
 * Reference data about published vendor frameworks, so it lives as code for the
 * same reasons the certification catalogue does (public-pages-handoff §2.3): it
 * must be reviewable in a diff, it is needed at build time by tests, and a
 * scoring scheme whose axes can change without a commit is one nobody can
 * audit.
 *
 * **Every set below was read off the vendor's own documentation on 2026-07-30,
 * not recalled.** That matters because the counts are not what you would guess:
 * AWS and Google both have six, Azure has five, and Google's set is not a
 * superset of Azure's — "Performance optimization" and "Security, privacy, and
 * compliance" are Google's names, not Azure's. Publishing a score against a
 * pillar a vendor does not define would be a claim we could not defend, so
 * `frameworkUrl` is on every entry to say where the definition came from.
 *
 * `id` is ours and must stay stable — stored assessments reference it forever.
 * `label` is the vendor's wording and may be corrected to match theirs.

   * VMware is deliberately absent, and it is not an oversight.

   * The VMware Cloud Well-Architected Framework's five pillars are Plan, Build,
   * Secure, Modernize and Operate — **lifecycle phases, not quality
   * attributes**. Scoring a design 0–100 on "Plan" does not mean what scoring it
   * on "Reliability" means, and putting the two on the same radar would imply a
   * comparability that does not exist.
   *
   * Nothing is blocked by this: VMware has no architecture designs and no
   * blueprint data. Decide the shape when there is a design to score — the
   * honest options are to score VMware designs against the framework of the
   * cloud they run on (AVS → Azure, VMC → AWS), or to give VMware its own
   * non-radar presentation that respects the lifecycle model.
